ACRA may approve the application if there is reasonable cause to believe that the LLP is not carrying on business and the LLP is able to satisfy the criteria for striking off.\nHow to Apply\nThe LLP or a registered filing agent can submit the\napplication\nfor striking off. There is no fee payable for this transaction.\nAfter logging in to the BizFile+ website, go to \"eServices\" and select \"Limited Liability Partnership\" followed by \"Close a Limited Liability Partnership\". Once at the page, you would be able to see the various striking off options and the detailed e-guides for reference.\nReview Process for Striking Off\nOnce the application is approved, ACRA may send a striking off letter to the LLP\u2019s registered office address, its partners and managers at their residential address and to IRAS and CPFB.\nIf there is no objection, ACRA will publish the name of the LLP in the Government Gazette. This is known as the First Gazette Notification.\nAfter 60 days from the First Gazette Notification, if there is no objection, ACRA will publish the name of the LLP in the Government Gazette again and the name of the LLP will be struck off the register. The date that the LLP is struck off will be stated. This is known as the Final Gazette Notification.\nThe entire process will take at least 4 months.\nLodgment of an Objection Against Striking Off\nAny interested person can submit an objection against a striking off application. There is no fee payable for this transaction.\nIf ACRA receives any objection, we will inform the LLP of the objection. The LLP is given 2 months to resolve the matter. If the LLP is unable to resolve the matter within 2 months, the striking off application will lapse. The LLP can only submit a new application after the objection has been cleared.\nClearance of an Objection To Striking Off\nThe person who objects to the striking off application must login to Bizfile+\u00a0to clear the objection within 2 months from the objection lodgement date, before ACRA can proceed to continue with the striking off process. There is no fee payable for this transaction.\nNOTE:\u00a0Please ensure that there is no outstanding tax credit owing to the LLP before applying for striking off. When the LLP is dissolved, any tax credit due to the LLP will be paid over to the Insolvency Office. The partners of the defunct LLP may approach Insolvency Office if they wish to claim the tax credit. Please note that Insolvency Office may impose charges for the processing of the claim. For more information on how to make a claim, please visit\nInsolvency Office's website\n.\nDid you find this page useful?\nback to top\nAccounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority\nHow-to Guides\nNews and Events\nLegislation\nProsecution Highlights\nEnforcement Notices\nCorporate Service Providers\nPublic Accountants and Accounting Entities\nAQI Industry Information\nBusiness Registry Statistics\nTraining and Resources\nXBRL Filing and Resources\nSingapore Chartered Accountant Qualification\n2023/06/30\nWho We Are\nCareers\nSign Up for News Update\nBy submitting, I agree to the\nterms and conditions.\nContact Us\nFeedback\nReport Vulnerability\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nRate this Site\nSitemap\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\nBest viewed using IE 11+, Firefox 27+, Chrome 22+ and Safari 7+\n2023/06/28"}, {"title": "\r\n\tPreparing Financial Statements\r\n", "source": "https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/preparing-financial-statements", "content": "Preparing Financial Statements\nA Singapore Government Agency Website\nHow to identify\nOfficial website links end with .gov.sg\nGovernment agencies communicate via\n.gov.sg\nwebsites\n(e.g. go.gov.sg/open)\n.\nTrusted websites\nSecure websites use HTTPS\nLook for a\nlock\n(\n) or https:// as an added precaution.

Agenda decisions often include explanatory material, which explains how the applicable principles and requirements in IFRS Standards apply to the question submitted. Explanatory material derives its authority from IFRS Standards themselves. Accordingly, an entity is required to apply the applicable IFRS Standard(s), reflecting the explanatory material in an agenda decision (subject to it having sufficient time to implement that accounting).

With the enactment of the Accounting Standards Act 2007, the Accounting Standards Council (the Council) took over the task of making or formulating accounting standards for companies from the Council on Corporate Disclosure and Governance (CCDG). In addition, the Council was responsible for the making or formulation of accounting standards for charities, co-operative societies and societies. The creation of the Council was a positive step towards ensuring consistency in accounting standards, facilitating comparison of financial statements between different entities and enhancing the credibility and transparency of financial reporting.\nWith the passing of the Accountancy Functions (Consolidation) Act 2022, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA), the Council, and the Singapore Accountancy Commission merged under one entity (ACRA) with effect from 1 April 2023. The Act conferred the function of making or formulation of accounting standards for companies, charities, co-operative societies and societies on ACRA and reconstituted the Council as the Accounting Standards Committee (ASC) under ACRA, to continue performing the function of making or formulation of accounting standards in the same way as the Council had done. The Act also provided for any accounting standards made or formulated or deemed to have been made or formulated, and any practice directions issued or deemed to have been issued, by the Council before 1 April 2023, and which have not been revoked before that date, to continue in force after that date as if made or formulated or issued by the ASC after that date.

Companies which adopt new technologies quickly will reap the benefits of this transformation. To survive and grow in this changing business environment, companies need to look into the impact of technology on jobs roles. Which technologies are driving change in accountancy jobs, and how have they affected job roles? How can employers transform existing jobs to adapt to new demands, and how can workers acquire the right skills for these changes?\nThe Jobs Transformation Maps (JTMs) for Accounting Practices and In-house Finance & Accounting (F&A) functions were launched on 5 January 2022 by the Singapore Accountancy Commission (SAC) and the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), supported by Workforce Singapore (WSG) and SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG), to address these questions. The JTM studies can be found here:\nJTM for Accounting Practices\n(PDF, 4.7MB)\nJTM for In-house F&A Functions\n(PDF, 2.7MB)\nThe JTM studies found that the accountancy sector will continue to grow, creating new job roles and increased demand for manpower; and companies will grow if technology is embraced at all levels. New initiatives will support companies and professionals to get ready for the future of work.\nRise in demand for manpower\nDemand for accounting and other professionals will continue to grow in the accountancy sector. \u00a0 Accounting Practices will require increased manpower as their clients grow in digital maturity and their needs become more sophisticated. The In-House F&A segment will also see a rise in demand for manpower as they are critical in supporting companies which grow and expand from Singapore into the region. In all, there is a projected demand of 6,000 to 7,000 new accounting jobs by 2025. This will add to the current workforce of more than 100,000 employees, comprising about 80,000 employees in the In-house F&A functions and about 20,000 employees in Accounting Practices.\nEmerging job roles\nNew job roles are emerging to meet the new requirements of the changing global business environment. The JTM study identified 11 job roles emerging over the next two to five years.\nEmerging Job Roles\nAccounting Practices\nIn-House Finance and Accounting\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Specialists\nRegional Controller\nVendor Relationship Manager\nCitizen Data Scientist\nGovernance, Risk and Compliance Lead\nEthical Hackers\nFinance Data Steward\nFinance Automation Lead\nIT Auditors\nESG Lead\nFinance Transformation Lead\nSkills in demand\nTechnology and soft skills are increasingly in demand. Some of these technology skills include the ability to apply Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, Data Analysis and Interpretation, and Robotics and Automation. As the need for accountants to work with various stakeholders grow, soft skills such as interpersonal skills, adaptability, creative thinking, and customer orientation, will become more important.\nEmbracing technology at all levels\nThe JTM studies indicate the need to embrace technology at all levels to remain relevant in today\u2019s increasingly complex business and regulatory environment.\nThe JTMs studied 58 job roles of which the majority, ie, 45 job roles, will require minimal or moderate job redesign over the next two to five years. The studies found that these job roles are not susceptible to displacement as they involve more value-adding tasks. Nonetheless, these professionals will benefit from the automation of some tasks to enhance their ability to focus on higher value-adding tasks requiring judgment, deep technical knowledge and business acumen.\nThe remaining 13 job roles studied will see a high degree of change in job tasks and require greater job redesign and reskilling of employees over the next two to five years. These roles predominantly involve repetitive tasks that can be automated. Job roles that focus on process-oriented tasks will benefit from greater automation for improved efficiency and accuracy. These \u00a0jobs should be redesigned to allow employees to add greater value to the business; and staff should be re-skilled for these new roles.\nNew programmes: Get ready for the future of work\nNew programmes will help employers and employees in their transformation and upskilling efforts.\nAccountancy Job Redesign Initiative\nThrough the Accountancy Job Redesign Initiative, enterprises with In-House F&A functions, and Accounting Practices can receive funding support to engage consultants to streamline accounting work processes and implement accounting technology solutions to improve productivity and increase job value. They can receive up to 80% of the job redesign consultancy cost, capped at $ 30,000 per enterprise till 31 March 2022, through the Productivity Solutions Grant for Job Redesign (PSG-JR). Beyond 31 March 2022, the PSG-JR funding rate will revert to up to 70% of the job redesign consultancy cost, capped at $ 30,000 per enterprise.\nThe Job Redesign Initiative was developed by WSG, SAC and the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF). Click\nhere\nto apply.\nAccountancy Job Redesign Toolkit\nThe\nAccountancy Job Redesign Toolkit\nis a guide to redesign the top four job roles impacted by technology as cited by the JTMs. These are Accounts Executive, Senior Accounts Executive/Accountant, Tax Associate and Audit Associate. It includes a job evolution and training roadmap, change management strategies, case studies, and funding options for job redesign and adoption of technology solutions. The toolkit was developed by WSG, EDB, SAC and ISCA.\nIn-House Finance & Accounting Self-Assessment Questionnaires\nCorporates and Individuals can assess their current level of F&A sophistication, and take steps to progress to their desired level of sophistication with EDB\u2019s In-House Finance & Accounting Self-Assessment Questionnaires (SAQ). The results of the online self-assessment are compiled in a Report Card which will show a customised set of recommendations and links to resources that support F&A transformation. The SAQ is on the EDB\nwebsite\n.\nAccountancy Career Hub\nThe Accountancy Career Hub provides employment and employability support for the accountancy sector. It offers jobseekers career guidance, job matching services, skills upgrading courses, and industry-specific events. Jobseekers looking to enter the industry and accountancy professionals exploring new career tracks within the sector will find relevant help at the hub. \u00a0The Accountancy Career Hub was set up by NTUC\u2019s e2i, SAC and ISCA.

A RORC would contain the following information listed in the Section\n\u201cWhat information must be lodged with ACRA\u201d\nbelow.\nWith effect from 30 July 2020, in addition to keeping a RORC at their end, entities will have to lodge the same information in their RORC with ACRA\u2019s central register (ACRA central RORC) within 2 business days after the RORC has been setup, or after any update have been done to their own RORC.\nFor entities that wish to perform this lodgement with ACRA on their own, please follow the steps that can be found in the Section\n\u201cLodging RORC information with ACRA\u201d\nbelow.

Information in the ACRA central RORC will only be made available to law enforcement agencies for the purpose of administering or enforcing the laws under their purview (e.g. investigation of money laundering offences). Members of the public will not have access to the information in the ACRA central RORC.\nEntities Exempted from maintaining RORC\nThere are some entities that are exempted from keeping a RORC and need not lodge any information with ACRA central RORC.

A P.O. Box address cannot be used for any of these addresses.\nthis is a youtube video\nWatch a video summary on Types of Addresses Registered with ACRA\nBusiness Address (For sole-proprietorships, partnerships, and LPs)\nA Business Address is the place where you carry out your business.\nUnder the Home Office Scheme, you may use  your residential address as the business address. This scheme applies to both  HDB and private properties. You will need to seek prior  approval from\nHDB\nor\nURA\nrespectively.\nRegistered Office Address (For companies and LLPs)\nA registered office address refers to the place where all communications and notices to the company or LLP may be addressed, and the place where the company\u2019s or LLP\u2019s register and records are kept.\nA registered office must be operational and  accessible to the public during normal office hours, but need not be where the  company or LLP conducts its activities (e.g. registered office address is in  Raffles Place, but the factory is in Tuas).\nResidential  Address\nAll business owners and company officers must  provide their residential address to ACRA at the point of registration. These  addresses are made publicly available when the public purchases information  about the business entity. Alternatively, you can consider the Alternate  Address (below) if you prefer not to disclose your residential addresses  publicly.\nAlternate  Address\nFor personal data protection purposes, business owners and company officers have the option of registering an Alternate Address. Once you have registered an Alternate Address, it will be displayed in ACRA\u2019s public records instead of your residential address.\u00a0 However, all official correspondences from ACRA will continue to be sent to your residential address. You are therefore still required to submit your residential address for record purposes.\nThe alternate address must be an address where you can be contacted (e.g. your office, your corporate service provider\u2019s office, etc.), and must be within the same jurisdiction as the residential address. It cannot be a P.O.

Both the financial statements in the original language and in English language are to be filed as part of the annual filing.\n1\nPreviously only allow United States\u2019 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and those standards that have converged with the IFRS.\n(b) other foreign companies that had not prepared a set of financial statements in accordance to IFRS or accounting standards as required in the law of its country or incorporation / formation are required to prepare and lodge their financial statements prepared in accordance with the Accounting Standards, unless they have obtained approval from the ACRA under section 373(13) of the Companies Act, for relief from requirements relating to audit or form and content of the financial statements and other documents.\n(c) For clarity, there is no waiver of filing of foreign companies\u2019 financial statements.\nFor application under s373(13), the foreign company must provide the following documents during the application:\n(a) Balance sheet and income statement (including the financials of all its branch) ;\n(b) Significant accounting policies (including basis of measurement) prepared in accordance with the accounting standards required in the law of the foreign company\u2019s country of incorporation / formation; and\n(c) Statement by directors in the same format (i.e. whether the financial information is true and fair, whether the foreign company is able to pay its debts as and when it falls due and the list of directors in office at the date of the statement) as those of local Singapore companies.\nThe statement by directors must be signed by two of the foreign company\u2019s directors registered\n2\nwith ACRA, unless it has only one director registered with ACRA, in which case, the statement can be signed by that director.\n2\nForeign companies are required to lodge a list of its directors with ACRA at the time of registration and any change in directors must be lodged with ACRA within 30 days of change.\nSingapore Branch Accounts\nAll Singapore Branches are required to prepare audited profit and loss account which complies with the Accounting Standards and give a true and fair view of the profit or loss arising out of their operations in Singapore, and audited statement showing their assets used in and liabilities arising out of their operations in Singapore, and lodge these documents with ACRA, except under the following circumstances:\n(a) if the Singapore Branch is dormant\n3\naccording to section 373(9) of the Act, it may lodge with ACRA, an\nunaudited\nprofit and loss account with respect to its operations in Singapore and an\nunaudited\nstatement showing its assets used in and liabilities arising out of its operations in Singapore;\n3\nA Singapore Branch is considered as dormant when there is no accounting transaction arising out of its operations in Singapore.

One of the options available is to strike off the name of the company from the register.\nAs a director, you may apply to ACRA to strike off the company's name from the register. ACRA may approve the application if it has reasonable cause to believe that the company is not carrying on business and the company is able to satisfy the following criteria for striking off.\nThe company has not commenced business since incorporation or has ceased trading.\nThe company has no outstanding debts owed to Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS), Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board and any other government agency.\nThere are no outstanding charges in the charge register.\nThe company is not involved in any legal proceedings (within or outside Singapore).\nThe company is not subject to any ongoing or pending regulatory action or disciplinary proceeding.\nThe company has no existing assets and liabilities as at the date of application and no contingent asset and liabilities that may arise in the future.\nAll/majority of the director(s) authorise you, as the applicant, to submit the online application for striking off on behalf of the company.\nImportant : Outstanding Tax Credit\nNOTE: Please ensure that there is no outstanding tax credit owing to the company before applying for striking off. When the company is dissolved, any tax credit due to the company will be paid over to the Insolvency and Public Trustee\u2019s Office (IPTO). The shareholders of the defunct company may approach IPTO if they wish to claim the tax credit. Please note that IPTO may impose charges for the processing of the claim. For more information on how to make a claim, please visit IPTO's website.\nApplication to strike off a company\nThe company director, the company secretary or the registered filing agent can submit an online application via BizFile+\u00a0using SingPass or CorpPass to strike off the company.\nThere is no filing fee for this transaction.\nReview process for striking off\nOnce the application is approved, ACRA may send a striking off notice to the company\u2019s registered office address, its officers (such as director, company secretary and shareholder) at their address in our records..\nAfter 30 days from the approval of the striking off application, if there is no objection, ACRA will publish the name of the company in the Government Gazette. This is known as the First Gazette Notification.\nAfter 60 days from the First Gazette Notification, if there is no objection, ACRA will publish the name of the company in the Government Gazette again and the name of the company will be struck off the register. The date that the company is struck off will be stated. This is known as the Final Gazette Notification.\nThe entire process will take at least 4 months.\nLodgment of an Objection Against Striking Off\nAny interested person can submit an objection against a striking off application. There is no fee payable for this transaction. If ACRA receives any objection, we will inform the company of the objection. The company is given 2 months to resolve the matter. If the company is unable to resolve the matter within 2 months, the striking off application will lapse. The company can only submit a new application after the objection has been cleared.\nWithdrawal of Striking Off Application\nA company can apply for withdrawal of its application for striking off via BizFile+.\nThere is no filing fee for this transaction.\nAfter a Company has been Struck Off\nA company can be restored within 6 years after the company's name has been struck off, by a Court Order. The Court Order must be lodged via BizFile+\u00a0and the status of the company will be updated to \u201clive\u201d.\nThere is no filing fee for this transaction.\nRelated eServices\nAPPLY for Striking-Off\nLODGEMENT of Court Order for Restoration of Struck Off Company\nLODGMENT or Clearance of an Objection Against Striking Off\nYou May Also Like\nClosing a Company\nCompany-Related Fees\nFiling Annual Returns\nDid you find this page useful?\nback to top\nAccounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority\nHow-to Guides\nNews and Events\nLegislation\nProsecution Highlights\nEnforcement Notices\nCorporate Service Providers\nPublic Accountants and Accounting Entities\nAQI Industry Information\nBusiness Registry Statistics\nTraining and Resources\nXBRL Filing and Resources\nSingapore Chartered Accountant Qualification\n2023/06/30\nWho We Are\nCareers\nSign Up for News Update\nBy submitting, I agree to the\nterms and conditions.\nContact Us\nFeedback\nReport Vulnerability\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nRate this Site\nSitemap\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\nBest viewed using IE 11+, Firefox 27+, Chrome 22+ and Safari 7+\n2024/07/02"}, {"title": "\r\n\tRegistering as a Public Accountant\r\n", "source": "https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/registering-guide", "content": "Registering as a Public Accountant\nA Singapore Government Agency Website\nHow to identify\nOfficial website links end with .gov.sg\nGovernment agencies communicate via\n.gov.sg\nwebsites\n(e.g. go.gov.sg/open)\n.\nTrusted websites\nSecure websites use HTTPS\nLook for a\nlock\n(\n) or https:// as an added precaution.

When a VCC or sub-fund applies for a loan from a bank or other institutions, it will often give security to the creditor. One common form of security is a\ncharge\nover assets.\nDefinition of a Charge\nA charge is a form of security interest usually taken by a lender or creditor (\u201cchargee\u201d) to secure repayment of a loan.\nTypes of Charges\nFixed Charge\nA charge secured on fixed assets (e.g. land and buildings, a ship, piece of machinery, shares, intellectual property such as copyrights, patents, trademarks, etc.)\nFloating Charge\nA charge secured on non-specific assets or generic categories (e.g. inventory, cash, stocks, accounts receivable).\nA floating charge \u2018floats\u2019 over the secured assets. It is only converted into a fixed charge if, for example, the company fails to repay the loan.\nRegistering a New Charge\nWhen a charge is created for a VCC/sub-fund, it must be registered with ACRA.\nThe following charges must be registered:\na charge to secure any issue of debentures\na charge on uncalled share capital of a VCC, or an umbrella VCC in respect of its sub-fund\na charge on shares of a subsidiary of a VCC which are owned by the VCC, or by the VCC (being an umbrella VCC) for the purpose of its sub-fund\na charge of an assignment created or evidenced by an instrument which, if executed by an individual, would require registration as a bill of sale\na charge on land wherever situate or any interest therein\na charge on book debts of the VCC or a sub-fund\na floating charge on the undertaking or property of a VCC or a sub-fund\na charge on calls made but not paid\na charge on a ship or aircraft or any share in a ship or aircraft\na charge on goodwill, on a patent or licence under a patent, on a trade mark, or on a copyright or a licence under a copyright\nThe full list of charges and rules governing registration of charges can be found in sections 131 to 141 of Division 8 of the Companies Act as applied by section 42 of the VCC Act.\nWho Must Register\nAll VCCs and their sub-funds incorporated / registered in Singapore may register charges.\nWhen To Register\nA charge must be registered within 30 days of its creation.\nHow To Register\nEngage the services of a registered filing agent (e.g. law firm, accounting firm or corporate secretarial firm) to submit the Registration of Charge on behalf of the VCC. VCC officers (i.e. Directors and Secretaries) may submit the filing via\nVCC Portal\n(www.vcc.bizfile.gov.sg).\nAfter Registering\nAfter registration, ACRA will send an email notification confirming the registration of the charge. The email notification serves as evidence that the VCC has complied with the requirements.\nPossible Outcomes of Late Registration\nFailure to register the charge is an offence. If convicted, VCC officers may be fined up to $1,000. Non-compliance may also render the charge void against the liquidator or other secured creditors of the VCC.\nCharges in Singapore\nExtension of time is\nnot\nallowed for charge instruments created in Singapore. If the VCC or sub-fund did not register the charge\nwithin 30 days\n, the VCC or sub-fund will have to obtain a Court Order, and register the charge within the period granted by the Court.\nCharges Outside Singapore\nExtension of time is allowed for charge instruments created outside of Singapore. If the VCC or sub-fund did not register the charge\nwithin 37 days\n, the VCC or sub-fund will have to obtain a Court Order. Once an extension of time is granted, the VCC is given up to\n3 months\nto register the charge.\nVariation of Charge\nA variation of charge is an agreement to vary the terms of the original charge that was registered earlier (e.g. the amount secured or change in chargee). This transaction will be available later this year. No fee is payable for this transaction.\nSatisfaction of Charge\nWhen a debt has been paid up in whole or in part, the VCC needs to file with ACRA a statement of satisfaction of the debt in order to release the charge. Upon successful filing, the charge will be removed from the Register.\nVCCs may engage a registered filing agent to assist in filing the Satisfaction of Charge. There is no filing fee for this transaction\nDid you find this page useful?\nback to top\nAccounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority\nHow-to Guides\nNews and Events\nLegislation\nProsecution Highlights\nEnforcement Notices\nCorporate Service Providers\nPublic Accountants and Accounting Entities\nAQI Industry Information\nBusiness Registry Statistics\nTraining and Resources\nXBRL Filing and Resources\nSingapore Chartered Accountant Qualification\n2023/06/30\nWho We Are\nCareers\nSign Up for News Update\nBy submitting, I agree to the\nterms and conditions.\nContact Us\nFeedback\nReport Vulnerability\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nRate this Site\nSitemap\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\nBest viewed using IE 11+, Firefox 27+, Chrome 22+ and Safari 7+\n2023/03/17"}, {"title": "\r\n\tCompliance and Enforcement Measures\r\n", "source": "https://www.acra.gov.sg/compliance/enforcement-policy-statement/compliance-and-enforcement-measures", "content": "Compliance and Enforcement Measures\nA Singapore Government Agency Website\nHow to identify\nOfficial website links end with .gov.sg\nGovernment agencies communicate via\n.gov.sg\nwebsites\n(e.g. go.gov.sg/open)\n.\nTrusted websites\nSecure websites use HTTPS\nLook for a\nlock\n(\n) or https:// as an added precaution.

These obligations apply to all directors regardless of whether a director claims to be non-executive or is a nominee.\nThe AGM provides shareholders with the opportunity to question the directors on the management and financial performance of the company. This is facilitated by requiring the directors to lay the company\u2019s accounts at the AGM and provide these accounts to all shareholders not less than 14 days before the AGM.\nThe AR provides critical information that helps the company\u2019s stakeholders to make informed decisions. It is also an opportunity to update company information with ACRA so that company information is current and accurate. The format of the AR is prescribed under the Companies Act. The AR is an electronic form lodged with ACRA through its online filing system \u2013 Bizfile+ and contains important particulars of the company such as the name of the directors, its shareholders, the date to which the accounts of the company are made up and the date of the AGM at which those accounts were laid before the company.\nIn view of the importance of holding AGMs and filing AR, ACRA has a system to pro-actively monitor these statutory breaches and has taken steps to instill compliance with these statutory obligations that are often breached by companies and/or their directors:\nFor FYE ending on or after 31 Aug 2018\na. failure by company and its directors to hold an AGM within the stipulated timeline.\u00a0Listed companies are to hold the AGM within 4 months after its\nFinancial Year End (FYE),\nwhile any other company is to hold their AGM within 6 months after FYE - section 175 Companies Act\nb. failure by company and its directors to file an AR within\u00a0the stipulated timeline. Listed companies are to file their AR within 5 months\nafter FYE\n, and for all other companies, within 7 months\nafter FYE\n. For companies having a share capital and keeping a branch register outside Singapore, Annual Returns must be filed within 6 months after FYE in the case of listed companies or within 8 months after FYE in the case of companies that are not listed \u2013 section 197 Companies Act.\nFor FYE ending before 31 Aug 2018\nc.\u00a0failure by company and its directors to hold an AGM within the stipulated timeline. Listed companies are to hold their AGM once in every calendar year and not more than 15 months after holding the last preceding AGM. All other companies are to hold their AGM once in every calendar year and not more than 15 months (18 months for new companies from the date of their incorporation) after holding the last preceding AGM - Section 175 Companies Act\nd. failure by directors to lay updated financial statements of their companies at their AGM within the stipulated timeline. Listed companies must lay financial statements made up to a date not more than 4 months before the date of their AGM, while all other companies are to lay their financial statements made up to a date not more than 6 months before the date of their AGM - section 201 Companies Act.\ne. failure by companies and directors to file their AR within the stipulated timeline. Listed and any other companies must file their AR within 30 days after the date of their AGM - section 197 Companies Act.\nACRA\u2019s 3\u201dE\u201d's approach\nACRA has deployed a 3\u2019E\u201d's enforcement strategy to address these 2 common breaches.\nEducation\n- Company directors who would like to know more about their statutory duties and obligations can refer to the Directors Training Programme (www.biztrg.sg) that is offered by ACRA free of charge.\nEnforcement\n\u2013 tougher enforcement action will be taken against egregious cases (e.g. multiple breaches or repeat offenders). If the offenders do not agree to pay the composition sums, they will be charged for the offences. Deterrent court fines will be sought if appropriate.\nEradication\n\u2013 ACRA will initiate the striking off of companies that are not carrying on business or not in operation.\nCompanies and every director that breach their statutory obligations may be a composition sum\nin lieu of facing prosecution. ACRA may prosecute the directors in court if they do not accept the offer of composition.\nACRA may also not offer composition after a summons is issued. \u00a0ACRA will serve the summons to the director at his residential address by registered post. The summons will indicate the date, time and which Court that the director has to appear before. If the director fails to attend court, a warrant for his arrest will be issued by the court. The director must attend court even if he has made representations to ACRA.\nProsecution and seeking higher court fines\nFor egregious cases that are prosecuted in court, ACRA will not offer composition, especially if the offender has pleaded guilty to not holding the AGM and not filing the AR before or compounded multiple breaches before.\nDid you find this page useful?\nback to top\nAccounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority\nHow-to Guides\nNews and Events\nLegislation\nProsecution Highlights\nEnforcement Notices\nCorporate Service Providers\nPublic Accountants and Accounting Entities\nAQI Industry Information\nBusiness Registry Statistics\nTraining and Resources\nXBRL Filing and Resources\nSingapore Chartered Accountant Qualification\n2023/06/30\nWho We Are\nCareers\nSign Up for News Update\nBy submitting, I agree to the\nterms and conditions.\nContact Us\nFeedback\nReport Vulnerability\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nRate this Site\nSitemap\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\nBest viewed using IE 11+, Firefox 27+, Chrome 22+ and Safari 7+\n2022/10/02"}, {"title": "\r\n\tReserving a Business Name\r\n", "source": "https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/before-you-start/reserving-a-business-name", "content": "Reserving a Business Name\nA Singapore Government Agency Website\nHow to identify\nOfficial website links end with .gov.sg\nGovernment agencies communicate via\n.gov.sg\nwebsites\n(e.g. go.gov.sg/open)\n.\nTrusted websites\nSecure websites use HTTPS\nLook for a\nlock\n(\n) or https:// as an added precaution.

A set of financial statements that complies with the accounting standards will provide reliable and comparable information to the stakeholders for decision-making.\nAs the regulator of companies, ACRA enquires with the directors where it appears that the financial statements are not compliant with the accounting standards through the Financial Reporting Surveillance Programme (FRSP).\nWhen material non-compliances with accounting standards are established, we may take the following actions:\nissue advisory letters to inform directors of the material non-compliances and encourage them to take note in the preparation of future financial statements;\nseek remediation actions from the company, such as revision of past financial statements. This facilitates the communication of reliable and comparable financial information to investors;\nissue warning or impose composition sum against the directors to deter future offence(s); and/or\nprosecute directors in court to deter potential offender(s).\nWe also work with professional bodies to build the competency of directors and preparers of financial statements.\nReporting to the Public\nTo enhance transparency, we publish reports summarising the activities and findings of the FRSP. These reports aim to help companies avoid the common pitfalls and improve their financial reporting by enhancing their understanding of the application and interpretation of the Accounting Standards and the requirements of the Act. Read the\nFRSP reports\n.\nFinancial Reporting Resources for Companies and Directors\nTo guide directors and other financial statements preparers, we publish Financial Reporting Practice Guidance highlighting the areas of the FRSP\u2019s review focus for the coming year. This will remind directors of the risks of misstatements in the financial statements as well as how to better meet the information needs of investors and other users of financial statements.

Appointing the right auditor who can act as an effective and independent gatekeeper is crucial to protecting the interests of investors.\nAudit Committees (AC) play a key role in evaluating and selecting the right auditor for listed companies. There is however limited information available for ACs to measure and evaluate the quality of an audit. Thus, differentiating and selecting the audit firm best suited to the size and complexity of a company can be a difficult task.\nIn October 2015, ACRA introduced an Audit Quality Indicators (AQIs) Disclosure Framework to help ACs of listed companies better evaluate and select the right auditor. The AQI Disclosure Framework comprises comparable quality markers that correlate closely with audit quality. In August 2016, to further enhance the use of AQIs, ACRA introduced six targets on selected AQIs to provide ACs with a common yardstick for comparison and to facilitate meaningful audit quality conversations with the auditors.\nAs part of ongoing efforts to raise audit quality, ACRA regularly monitors the effectiveness of the AQI Disclosure Framework and its relevance to ACs. Following a detailed review which included extensive consultations with audit firms and ACs, ACRA has revised the AQI Disclosure Framework, taking into account feedback from audit firms and ACs, to ensure that the indicators can better meet the needs of the ACs. The revised Framework and changes are summarised below:\n1. Revisions to the ACRA\u2019s AQIs Disclosure Framework\nOriginal AQIs in Framework\nWhat has changed?\nRevised AQIs\nAudit hours \u2013\nTime spent by senior team members\nTo include breakdown of hours incurred by the audit engagement team by grade and by the various audit phases (e.g. planning, fieldwork and completion)\nRationale: To track achievement of milestones and to assess the timeliness of auditor involvement\nAudit hours \u2013 Involvement of audit team members during each audit phase\nQuality Control \u2013\nHeadcount of partners and managers in quality control functions\nTo include total headcount of quality control personnel and to present in relative terms as a ratio of total audit staff headcount\nQuality Control \u2013 Headcount of partners, managers and professional staff in quality control functions and comparison vis-\u00e0-vis audit staff strength\nIndependence \u2013\nCompliance with independence requirements\nRemoved from framework\nRationale: Firms are already declaring their independence to their audit clients under the relevant professional standards (e.g. ACRA's Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics)\nTraining \u2013\nAverage training hours and industry specific training\nNo change\nInspections \u2013\nResults of External and Internal Inspections\nNo change\nStaff oversight \u2013\nStaff per partner / manager ratios\nNo change\nExperience \u2013\nYears of audit experience and industry specialisation\nNo change\nAttrition rate \u2013\nDegree of personnel losses\nNo change\n2. Disclosure of industry average and range for relevant AQIs\nIn place of the AQI targets introduced in 2016, ACRA will instead provide relevant information on industry average and range for the audit firms in the listed companies segment (categorised by Big 4 and non-Big 4 firms), to better facilitate industry comparison:\nAQIs\nIndustry information\nStaff oversight \u2013\nStaff per partner / manager ratio\nPartner to Audit professional staff and Manager leverage ratio\nManager to Audit professional staff leverage ratio\nExperience \u2013\nYears of audit experience and industry specialisation\nAverage years of experience (by grade)\nAttrition rate \u2013\nDegree of personnel losses\nStaff attrition rate (overall)\nThe industry information will be updated every half-yearly and annually, and published on the ACRA website as follows:\nDuration\nPublished on ACRA website\n6 months period ending 31 Mar\n30 Jun\n12 months period ending 30 Sep\n31 Dec\nPlease click\nhere\n(PDF, 169KB)\u00a0for the latest industry information.\nThe revised AQI Disclosure Framework is available for voluntary adoption by audit firms for audits of financial statements of listed entities in Singapore for periods ending on or after 31 March 2020. Audit firms are encouraged to adopt the revised AQI Disclosure Framework early, and to share the AQI data with the ACs so as to ensure meaningful analysis and discussion.\nResources\nGuidance for Audit Committees\nGuidance to audit committees on ACRA's Revised AQI Disclosure Framework\n(PDF, 388KB) &\nSample presentation format for ACRA's Revised AQI Disclosure Framework\n(PDF, 166KB) \u2013 Information to help ACs with practical application of the AQIs and how each AQI should be interpreted.\nGuidance for Audit Firms\nGuidance to audit firms on ACRA's Revised AQI Disclosure Framework\n(PDF, 302KB) \u2013 Information to help audit firms in computing and preparing their AQI data to ensure consistency and comparability\nPast Resources\nACRA-CPA Australia\u00a0Joint Publication on Audit Quality Indicators\n(PDF, 1.04MB)\nGuidance to Audit Committees on ACRA\u2019s Audit Quality Indicators Disclosure Framework\n(PDF, 0.97MB)\nGuidance to Audit Firms\n(PDF, 1.08MB)\nSample Presentation Format for ACRA\u2019s\u00a0AQI framework\n(Word, 53.6KB)\nPress Release\nGroundbreaking Audit Quality Indicators Framework to Raise Audit Quality of Financial Reporting in Singapore\n(PDF, 220KB)\nSpeech\nKeynote Address by Mr Kenneth Yap, ACRA Chief Executive, at the 2015 CPA Australia Congress\n(PDF, 294KB)\nDid you find this page useful?\nback to top\nAccounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority\nHow-to Guides\nNews and Events\nLegislation\nProsecution Highlights\nEnforcement Notices\nCorporate Service Providers\nPublic Accountants and Accounting Entities\nAQI Industry Information\nBusiness Registry Statistics\nTraining and Resources\nXBRL Filing and Resources\nSingapore Chartered Accountant Qualification\n2023/06/30\nWho We Are\nCareers\nSign Up for News Update\nBy submitting, I agree to the\nterms and conditions.\nContact Us\nFeedback\nReport Vulnerability\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nRate this Site\nSitemap\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\nBest viewed using IE 11+, Firefox 27+, Chrome 22+ and Safari 7+\n2024/06/28"}, {"title": "\r\n\tSetting Up a Local Company\r\n", "source": "https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/setting-up-a-local-company", "content": "Setting Up a Local Company\nA Singapore Government Agency Website\nHow to identify\nOfficial website links end with .gov.sg\nGovernment agencies communicate via\n.gov.sg\nwebsites\n(e.g. go.gov.sg/open)\n.\nTrusted websites\nSecure websites use HTTPS\nLook for a\nlock\n(\n) or https:// as an added precaution.

We strive to safeguard Singapore\u2019s reputation as not only a trusted marketplace but also easiest places in the world to do business in. For our stakeholders to better understand our approach to enforcement, this Enforcement Policy Statement categorically sets out how we deal with enforcement issues and how we apply the appropriate regulatory tools to address them.\nFor business owner, officers and corporate service providers\nThis Enforcement Policy Statement contains information relevant to businesses, business owners and its officers and corporate service providers. We urge these stakeholders to peruse this Policy Statement to better understand ACRA\u2019s enforcement approach.\nFor those who wish to lodge complaints\nFor members of public who intend to lodge or had lodged complaints with ACRA about alleged statutory breaches should read this Enforcement Policy Statement to better understand what information is required when lodging complaints, what types of cases warrant investigations, our investigation timelines, our key considerations when deciding on the enforcement action to take and the types of compliance and enforcement measures that ACRA undertakes.\nFor those who are being investigated and face prosecution\nFor members of the public who are being investigated by ACRA or are facing prosecution by ACRA should read this Enforcement Policy Statement which lists key statutory obligations, various enforcement measures that ACRA may undertake including composition and court fines and information on making representations to ACRA on compliance or investigation matters.\nOur enforcement philosophy is to encourage compliance and deter misconduct. It is important to note that we do not investigate offenders for each and every statutory breach but when we do, we will respond to different types of statutory breaches in different ways by applying one or more regulatory tools available to ACRA. These tools range from denial of service, imposing attendance of an outreach session, issuing of a warning, making an offer to pay a composition sum in lieu of prosecution, striking off, disqualifying, issuing of a debarment order to prosecution, with the possibility of seeking deterrent sentences in egregious cases.\nThe subject matter of certain cases may require us to refer to other law enforcement agencies such as the Police, the Commercial Affairs Department or some other regulators where it is more appropriate to do so. Examples include a penal offence such as criminal breach of trust under the Penal Code or a security-related offence under the Securities and Futures Act, both of which do not come under the purview of ACRA.\nTo maximise the use of ACRA\u2019s limited resources, ACRA will decide whether to take enforcement action by applying the following 3 key factors:\nwhether there is sufficient public interest\nwhat is the harm done by the alleged breach\nwhether the complaint is bona fide and if so, whether it contains sufficient information to mount investigations\nIf the complaint meets all 3 key considerations, investigation will be conducted followed by an assessment on whether to enforce and what is the appropriate regulatory tool to use.\nFactor 1 - Public Interest\nIn ascertaining if there is public interest, ACRA is guided by the following considerations.\nAccuracy and integrity of the public registers maintained by ACRA\nOne of ACRA\u2019s paramount concerns is the accuracy and integrity of these registers as members of the public and stakeholders such as investors and banks increasingly look to the public registers maintained by ACRA for relevant information about business entities.\nIn this regard, ACRA pays special focus to the failure to file Annual Returns (ARs) (breach of section 197 of the Companies Act (CA)). ACRA will investigate these breaches and take enforcement action.\nIf there is a failure to update change in existing information concerning directorships (breach of 173 CA) or registered address (breach of section 143 CA), ACRA will generally investigate.\nThe provision of timely and accurate financial information\nThe timely and accurate filing of financial information that must meet accounting standards is another one of ACRA\u2019s key areas of concern, especially in relation to listed companies and larger private companies as the public relies on such financial information to do business with or invest in these companies.\nFraud, false declarations and other forms of dishonest behaviour\nFraud, false declarations and other forms of dishonest behaviour that impact our public registers or financial information are viewed seriously and will be investigated by ACRA or the relevant enforcement agency.\nOne such example is that of a corporate service provider who was not paid his director\u2019s fees and proceeded to abuse his corporate service provider access by lodging a false declaration with ACRA that someone else had consented to be a director in his place. In addition, he back-dates the lodgement to the date he himself was appointed, as if he were never a director of the company at all. ACRA took this offender to task.\nBreach of Fiduciary Duties\nThe law imposes relationships of trust on certain individuals with the business entities and, where applicable with the shareholders as well. \u00a0Where such action impugns on the integrity or accuracy of ACRA\u2019s register, or where the nature of the breach is particularly serious, ACRA would be prepared to investigate and take enforcement action against an offender. - Notably, under section 157 of the CA, a director shall at all times act honestly and use reasonable diligence in the discharge of the duties of his office.\nFactor 2 - Harm Caused by the Breach\nA higher priority will be accorded to cases in which serious harm has been caused.\nIn assessing the extent of the harm caused by the breach, the following factors will be considered:\nthe extent of harm caused by the alleged breach to victims and/or to Singapore\u2019s reputation as a financial centre (including the extent of abuse by the business vehicles/persons behind the vehicles);\nwhether the commission of the alleged breach was premeditated or due to inadvertence. In some cases where filing errors are made, ACRA may simply require that a correction be made and not pursue the matter further. For example, a registrant who has genuinely made a typographical error such as typing a wrong number in his application concerning a certain registered business address;\nwhether there was rectification, restitution and/or compensation made by the offender;\nwhether the complainant has any other better recourse such as by civil action in the courts. For example, when a company decides not to effect share transfers in favour of an investor due to contractual/commercial disputes surrounding the circumstances.\nFactor 3 - Complaint must be Bona Fide and contain Sufficient Evidence\nAs the utilisation of ACRA\u2019s resources for investigation and enforcement action must be justified and thereafter prioritised, ACRA also takes into account the following:\nanonymous complaints will not be entertained;\nwhether the complaint arose from personal or contractual disputes;\nwhether the complainant is co-operative when ACRA seeks clarification or further evidence;\nthe quality and relevance of evidence provided by the complainant\nThe complaint must be supported by evidence that contains sufficient particulars to enable ACRA to commence investigation and establish that an offence had been made out. Information such as the name of offender, date offence committed, description of how the offence was committed together with supporting documents if applicable, must be provided to ACRA;\nThe source of the evidence should be credible and capable of being verified.\nthe complainant should not have any hidden agenda or vested interest in making the complaint. \u00a0An example of a hidden agenda would be to seek to use ACRA\u2019s enforcement action to obtain an advantage in civil proceedings or in the management of the affected business entity;\nthe complainant should also not have any adverse records with ACRA. An example would be when the complainant himself is under a Warrant of Arrest for failing to answer an ACRA summons.\nQuite a number of alleged breaches of the legislation administered by ACRA invariably arose from a consequence of disputes between private parties. As a national regulator, ACRA\u2019s resources would generally only be used to investigate and to enforce cases which involve the public interest. If there is no public interest involved, we will advise parties to resolve the matter privately and for the alleged breach to be rectified.\nAs an elaboration, contractual disputes or personal disputes will generally not be investigated by ACRA. These are some examples:\na person acts as a director or company secretary for a professional fee. The fee is not paid and the individual then resigns as a director/company and thereafter lodges a complaint with ACRA alleging that the company has breached its statutory filing obligation to notify ACRA of the resignation.\na person allows his business address to be used by a company as its registered business address for a fee. When the fee is not paid, the person then complains to ACRA that the company has no right to use his address.\nParty A agreed to inject funds in Party B\u2019s company in exchange for becoming a shareholder and director in the company. After the funds have been paid, Party A was not made a shareholder or director and wanted ACRA to investigate Party B.\nImportant: Giving False Information\nPlease also note that the giving of false information in the complaint is a criminal offence and the person who gave the false information may be subject to prosecution and sentenced to a fine and/or imprisonment if convicted\nDid you find this page useful?\nback to top\nAccounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority\nHow-to Guides\nNews and Events\nLegislation\nProsecution Highlights\nEnforcement Notices\nCorporate Service Providers\nPublic Accountants and Accounting Entities\nAQI Industry Information\nBusiness Registry Statistics\nTraining and Resources\nXBRL Filing and Resources\nSingapore Chartered Accountant Qualification\n2023/06/30\nWho We Are\nCareers\nSign Up for News Update\nBy submitting, I agree to the\nterms and conditions.\nContact Us\nFeedback\nReport Vulnerability\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nRate this Site\nSitemap\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\nBest viewed using IE 11+, Firefox 27+, Chrome 22+ and Safari 7+\n2023/05/10"}, {"title": "\r\n\tChoosing a Business Structure\r\n", "source": "https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/before-you-start/choosing-a-business-structure", "content": "Choosing a Business Structure\nA Singapore Government Agency Website\nHow to identify\nOfficial website links end with .gov.sg\nGovernment agencies communicate via\n.gov.sg\nwebsites\n(e.g. go.gov.sg/open)\n.\nTrusted websites\nSecure websites use HTTPS\nLook for a\nlock\n(\n) or https:// as an added precaution.

The VCC will complement the existing suite of investment fund structures available in Singapore.\nThe VCC Act and subsidiary legislation is administered by ACRA. All VCCs must be managed by a Permissible Fund Manager\n1\n. The anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism obligations of VCCs will come under the purview of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).\nSome key features of a VCC\nA VCC has a variable capital structure that provides flexibility in the issuance and redemption of its shares. It can also pay dividends out of capital, which gives fund managers flexibility to meet dividend payment obligations.\nA VCC can be set up as a single standalone fund or an umbrella fund with two or more sub-funds, each holding a portfolio of segregated assets and liabilities. For fund managers that structure their funds as umbrella VCCs, there may be cost efficiencies from using common service providers across the umbrella and its sub-funds.\nA VCC can be used for both open-ended and closed-end fund strategies\n2\n.\nFund managers may incorporate new VCCs or re-domicile their existing overseas investment funds with comparable structures by transferring their registration to Singapore as VCCs.\nVCCs must maintain a register of shareholders, which need not be made public. However, this register must be disclosed to public authorities upon request for regulatory, supervisory and law enforcement purposes.\nMore details pertaining to the VCC framework can be found at\nwww.mas.gov.sg\n.\n[1] Generally, a VCC will have to be managed by a fund manager which is a licensed fund management company (i.e. a holder of a capital markets services licence for fund management under section 86 of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap. 289)), a registered fund management company (i.e. a corporation exempted from holding a capital markets services licence under paragraph 5(1)(i) of the Second Schedule to the Securities and Futures (Licensing and Conduct of Business) Regulations) or a person exempted under the Section 99(1)(a), (b), (c), or (d) of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap. 289) from the requirement to hold a capital markets services licence to carry on business in fund management (i.e. a bank licensed under the Banking Act (Cap. 19), a merchant bank approved under the Monetary Authority of Singapore Act (Cap. 186), a finance company licensed under the Finance Companies Act (Cap. 108), or a company or cooperative society licensed under the Insurance Act (Cap. 142)).\n[2] An open-ended fund allows investors to redeem their investments at their discretion, while a closed-end fund does not permit investors to do so. Closed-end funds also have a fixed number of shares and do not allow new subscriptions after the offering period is over, while open-ended funds are open to new subscriptions by new investors at any time.\nSetting up a Variable Capital Company (VCC)\nIncorporate a VCC\nResources\nIndustry Notes by Second Minister For Finance, Ms Indranee Rajah\nIndustry Note on 2 Oct 2018\nIndustry Note on 24 Sep 2019\nMedia Release\nVCC Grant Scheme\nFAQs\nModel Constitution\nVCC How-to-Guide\nVCC Prescribed Forms\nSingapore Asset Management Survey 2019\nACRA Business Registry Statistics\nDid you find this page useful?\nback to top\nAccounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority\nHow-to Guides\nNews and Events\nLegislation\nProsecution Highlights\nEnforcement Notices\nCorporate Service Providers\nPublic Accountants and Accounting Entities\nAQI Industry Information\nBusiness Registry Statistics\nTraining and Resources\nXBRL Filing and Resources\nSingapore Chartered Accountant Qualification\n2023/06/30\nWho We Are\nCareers\nSign Up for News Update\nBy submitting, I agree to the\nterms and conditions.\nContact Us\nFeedback\nReport Vulnerability\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nRate this Site\nSitemap\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\nBest viewed using IE 11+, Firefox 27+, Chrome 22+ and Safari 7+\n2024/06/03"}, {"title": "\r\n\tShares and Updating Share information\r\n", "source": "https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/shares-and-updating-share-information", "content": "Shares and Updating Share information\nA Singapore Government Agency Website\nHow to identify\nOfficial website links end with .gov.sg\nGovernment agencies communicate via\n.gov.sg\nwebsites\n(e.g. go.gov.sg/open)\n.\nTrusted websites\nSecure websites use HTTPS\nLook for a\nlock\n(\n) or https:// as an added precaution.

One common form of security is a\ncharge\nover assets.\nDefinition of a Charge\nA charge is a form of security interest usually taken by a lender or creditor (\u201cchargee\u201d) to secure repayment of a loan.\nTypes of Charges\nFixed Charge\nA charge secured on fixed assets (e.g. land and buildings, a ship, piece of machinery, shares, intellectual property such as copyrights, patents, trade marks, etc.)\nFloating Charge\nA charge secured on non-specific assets or generic categories (e.g. inventory, cash, stocks, accounts receivable).\nA floating charge \u2018floats\u2019 over the secured assets. It is only converted into a fixed charge if, for example, the company fails to repay the loan.\nRegistering a New Charge\nWhen a charge is created, it must be registered with ACRA.\nThe following charges must be registered:\na charge to secure any issue of debentures\na charge on uncalled share capital of a company\na charge on shares of a subsidiary of a company which are owned by the company\na charge or an assignment created or evidenced by an instrument which, if executed by an individual, would require registration as a bill of sale\na charge on land wherever situate or any interest therein\na charge on book debts of the company\na floating charge on the undertaking or property of a company\na charge on calls made but not paid\na charge on a ship or aircraft or any share in a ship or aircraft\na charge on goodwill, on a patent or licence under a patent, on a trade mark, or on a copyright or a licence under a copyright\nThe full list of charges and rules governing registration of charges can be found in\nsections 131 to 141 of Division 8 of the Companies Act\n.\nWho Must Register\nRegistering a charge applies to\nall\nSingapore-registered local and foreign companies.\nWhen to Register\nA charge must be registered\nwithin 30 days of its creation\n.\nHow to Register\nEngage the services of a registered filing agent (e.g. law firm, accounting firm or corporate secretarial firm) to submit an online application on the company\u2019s behalf.Company Officers may submit the filing. Alternatively, the company director may submit the filing.\nAfter Registering\nApplication will be processed and approved after submission.\u00a0ACRA will send an email notification confirming the registration of the charge. The email notification will serve as conclusive evidence that the company has complied with the requirements.\nPossible Outcomes of Late Registration\nFailure to register the charge is an offence. If convicted, company officers may be fined\nup to S$1,000\n. Non-compliance may also render the charge void against the liquidator or other secured creditors of the company.\nCharge Created in Singapore\nExtension of time is\nnot\nallowed for charge instruments created in Singapore. If the company did not register the charge\nwithin 30 days\n, the company will have to obtain a Court Order under section 137 of the Companies Act for the time for registration to be extended, and register the charge within the extended period of time granted by the Court.\nCharge Created Outside Singapore\nExtension of time is allowed for charge instruments created\noutside\nSingapore. If the company did not register the charge\nwithin 37 days\n, the company will have to apply to ACRA under section 139 of the Companies Act for an extension of time to register the charge. ACRA will grant an extension of time of\n30 days\nfor the company\u00a0to register the charge.\nVariation of Charge\nA variation of charge is an agreement to vary the terms of the original charge (e.g. a variation of the amount secured or the chargee). The transaction must be done through\nBizFile\n+\n. No fee is payable for filing this transaction.\nSatisfaction of Charge\nWhen a debt for which the charge was given has been paid in whole or in part, the company needs to file with ACRA via\nBizFile\n+\n, a statement of satisfaction of the debt in order to release the charge. Upon successful filing, the charge will be removed from the register.\nCompanies may engage a registered filing agent to assist in filing the statement of satisfaction ('Satisfaction of Charge') with ACRA. There is no filing fee for this transaction.\nRelated eServices\nLODGMENT of New Charges\nSATISFACTION of Charges\nVARIATION of Charges\nDid you find this page useful?\nback to top\nAccounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority\nHow-to Guides\nNews and Events\nLegislation\nProsecution Highlights\nEnforcement Notices\nCorporate Service Providers\nPublic Accountants and Accounting Entities\nAQI Industry Information\nBusiness Registry Statistics\nTraining and Resources\nXBRL Filing and Resources\nSingapore Chartered Accountant Qualification\n2023/06/30\nWho We Are\nCareers\nSign Up for News Update\nBy submitting, I agree to the\nterms and conditions.\nContact Us\nFeedback\nReport Vulnerability\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nRate this Site\nSitemap\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\nBest viewed using IE 11+, Firefox 27+, Chrome 22+ and Safari 7+\n2021/04/09"}, {"title": "\r\n\tDirectors Duties in relation to Financial Reporting\r\n", "source": "https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/preparing-financial-statements/directors-duties-in-relation-to-financial-reporting", "content": "Directors Duties in relation to Financial Reporting\nA Singapore Government Agency Website\nHow to identify\nOfficial website links end with .gov.sg\nGovernment agencies communicate via\n.gov.sg\nwebsites\n(e.g. go.gov.sg/open)\n.\nTrusted websites\nSecure websites use HTTPS\nLook for a\nlock\n(\n) or https:// as an added precaution.

More than ever, investors, suppliers, financial institutions, customers, company directors, corporate executives and many more are asking for reliable and timely financial statements in order to obtain a more accurate picture of the business, whether in terms of generating value or understanding the risks involved.\nOver the past decade, businesses have also become more challenging and business models more complex. To cope with them, financial reporting standards have become increasingly complex and require more professional judgement on the part of the preparers of financial statements. Examples include the accounting for business acquisitions, the fair value measurement of assets and revenue recognition of multi-element transactions.\nIt is essential that the market remains confident in the level of transparency, integrity and quality of financial reporting. In response to this, ACRA has commenced a Financial Reporting Surveillance Programme to enforce against poor financial reporting that leads to unreliable information and/or non-compliance with the prescribed accounting standards.\nCompanies Act requirements\nUnder sections 201(2) and 201(5) of the Companies Act (the Act), directors are responsible to present and lay before the company, at its annual general meeting, financial statements that:\ncomply with Accounting Standards\n1\nissued by the Accounting Standards Council; and\ngive a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of the company.\nIn addition, directors of a company incorporated in Singapore are responsible to maintain a system of internal accounting controls and keep proper accounting and other records that will enable the preparation of true and fair financial statements under sections 199(2A) and 199(1) of the Act, respectively.\nGuidance to directors in carrying out these financial reporting duties\nReview of financial statements\n\u2013 Directors, whether executive or non-executive, should exercise care, competence and diligence in the review of the financial statements that are presented to shareholders and subsequently filed with ACRA.\u00a0Directors should read, understand and enquire into the form and content of the financial statements to ensure that the financial information presented is clear, complete and consistent with their understanding. Even if they are not accounting experts, directors should question the accounting treatments applied when the treatment does not reflect their understanding of the substance of arrangement. They should also apply professional scepticism when assessing management views\u2019 on areas of significant judgement and estimates.\nFinancial literacy\n\u2013 Directors are not expected to be accounting experts, but should have sufficient and up-to-date knowledge of the accounting principles and practices to perform an effective high-level review of the financial statements. Otherwise, directors should seek help and/or attend training.\nAppointment of management\n- Directors should ensure that senior management of the company, such as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), have adequate knowledge, competence, experience and integrity to undertake their roles.\nUnder the Code of Corporate Governance 2018, directors of listed companies should comment in the Annual Report on whether they have received assurance from the CEO and the CFO:\nthat the financial records have been properly maintained and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the company\u2019s operations and finances; and\nregarding the adequacy and effectiveness of the company's risk management and internal control systems.\nWhilst the assurance from the CEO and the CFO do not diminish the directors\u2019 responsibility in these areas, it can provide directors assurance that management has exercised due care in the financial reporting process.\nCompetent and adequately resourced finance function\n\u2013 Directors should ensure that management maintains competent and adequately resourced finance function who can prepare high quality financial statements. Qualified accountants should be recruited and provided with relevant and continuous training to keep them abreast of the financial reporting developments.\nUsing external help\n\u2013 Directors could seek professional accounting advice and/or outsource to professional accounting service providers the keeping of accounting and other records and the preparation of financial statements. However, they remain responsible and should ensure any such advice and/or service(s) are provided by suitably qualified persons with an appropriate level of expertise and knowledge of the accounting standards, and that such advice is unbiased and objective.\nWorking with the independent auditors\n\u2013 The independent auditors are required to communicate with those charged with governance on significant audit findings, including why they consider a significant accounting practice is not appropriate to the particular circumstances of the company, prior to issuance of the audit reports. Directors should resolve these issues amicably and seek help when necessary. Directors should not rely on the independent auditor in forming their own opinion on the financial statements. Doing so will undermine the objective of an independent audit.\nInternal control system and accounting and other records\n\u2013Directors should ensure that management adopts appropriate accounting policies, designs and implements appropriate internal controls and processes, and maintains complete and accurate accounting and other records. This obligation exists regardless of whether books and records are maintained in-house or outsourced to a third party.\nThe above is meant to guide directors in complying with certain significant duties in relation to financial reporting. They do not exhaustively define the duties applicable to directors under the Act and/or related legislation. When in doubt, legal advice should be sought by directors to clarify the scope of their duties.\nFinancial Reporting Resources for Companies and Directors\nACRA provides companies and directors with help resources such as:\nPractice Guidance\nFinancial Reporting Practice Guidance No. 1 of 2023: Areas of Review Focus for FY2023 Financial Statements\n(PDF, 244KB)\nFinancial Reporting Practice Guidance No. 1 of 2022: Areas of Review Focus for FY2022 Financial Statements\n(PDF, 205KB)\nFinancial Reporting Practice Guidance No. 1 of 2021: Areas of Review Focus for FY2021 Financial Statement under the Financial Reporting Surveillance Programme administered by ACRA\n(PDF, 278KB)\nFinancial Reporting Practice Guidance No. 2 of 2020: Areas of Review Focus for FY2020 Financial Statements under the Financial Reporting Surveillance Programme administered by ACRA\n(PDF, 488KB)\nFinancial Reporting Practice Guidance No. 1 of 2020: Proposed Areas of Review Focus by Directors on the Financial Statements Affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic\n(PDF, 539KB)\nFinancial Reporting Practice Guidance No. 2 of 2019: Areas of Review Focus for FY2019 Financial Statements under ACRA's Financial Reporting Surveillance Programme\n(PDF, 578KB)\nFinancial Reporting Practice Guidance No. 1 of 2019: Areas of Review Focus for FY2018 Financial Statements under the Financial Reporting Surveillance Programme administered by ACRA\n(PDF, 636KB)\nFinancial Reporting Practice Guidance No. 1 of 2018: Areas of Review Focus for FY2017 Financial Statements under the Financial Reporting Surveillance Programme administered by ACRA\n(PDF, 95KB)\nFinancial Reporting Practice Guidance No. 1 of 2016: Areas of Review Focus for FY2016 Financial Statements under the Financial Reporting Surveillance Programme administered by ACRA\n(PDF, 402KB)\nFinancial Reporting Practice Guidance No. 2 of 2015: Areas of Review Focus for FY2015 Financial Statements under the Financial Reporting Surveillance Programme administered by ACRA\n(PDF, 56KB)\nFinancial Reporting Practice Guidance No. 1 of 2015: Areas of Review Focus for FY2014 Financial Statements under the Financial Reporting Surveillance Programme administered by ACRA\n(PDF, 47KB)\nFinancial Reporting Practice Guidance No. 1 of 2014: Areas of Review Focus for FY2013 Financial Statements under the Financial Reporting Surveillance Programme administered by ACRA\n(PDF, 58KB)\nFinancial Reporting Practice Guidance No. 1 of 2012: Accounting Considerations in an Uncertain Economic Environment\n(PDF, 126KB)\n1\nAccounting Standards refer to Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I)s), Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (SFRS), Singapore Financial Reporting Standards for Small Entities (SFRS for SE) and Charities Accounting Standards.\nDid you find this page useful?\nback to top\nAccounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority\nHow-to Guides\nNews and Events\nLegislation\nProsecution Highlights\nEnforcement Notices\nCorporate Service Providers\nPublic Accountants and Accounting Entities\nAQI Industry Information\nBusiness Registry Statistics\nTraining and Resources\nXBRL Filing and Resources\nSingapore Chartered Accountant Qualification\n2023/06/30\nWho We Are\nCareers\nSign Up for News Update\nBy submitting, I agree to the\nterms and conditions.\nContact Us\nFeedback\nReport Vulnerability\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nRate this Site\nSitemap\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\nBest viewed using IE 11+, Firefox 27+, Chrome 22+ and Safari 7+\n2023/11/06"}, {"title": "\r\n\tCancellation of Registration as a Filing Agent or Qualified Individual\r\n", "source": "https://www.acra.gov.sg/corporate-service-providers/cancellation-of-registration-as-a-filing-agent-or-qualified-individual", "content": "Cancellation of Registration as a Filing Agent or Qualified Individual\nA Singapore Government Agency Website\nHow to identify\nOfficial website links end with .gov.sg\nGovernment agencies communicate via\n.gov.sg\nwebsites\n(e.g. go.gov.sg/open)\n.\nTrusted websites\nSecure websites use HTTPS\nLook for a\nlock\n(\n) or https:// as an added precaution.

This may take longer during peak period or if further clarifications are required. Each appeal is assessed and considered on its own merits.\nPlease note that appeals may be rejected after ACRA's consideration. Some common examples are listed below:\nReason cited in Appeal\nWhy the Appeal is Rejected\n(a)\nJust a nominee or \u201csleeping\u201d director\nThe Companies Act does not recognise nominee or \u201csleeping\u201d. All directors are under a duty to act honestly and diligently in the discharge of their duties.\n(b)\nDo not have the time or money to deal with compliance requirements\nCompliance with the law should form part of the management of a business right from the start. Budget and resources in relation to compliance matters should be provided for right from the start of every business and thereafter, every year.\n(c)\nCompany is small and cannot justify the cost of hiring a corporate secretary\n(d)\nDo not know how to use the online system to file Annual Returns.\nACRA\u2019s website provides step-by-step guides for setting up and closing a business, as well as on compliance matters. Please click\nhere\nif you would like to make an enquiry.\n(e)\nThe duty is on the hired corporate secretary to take care of matters\nDirectors are responsible for compliance matters. \u00a0Directors may engage professionals or instruct their staff but they are ultimately accountable to meet their statutory obligations.\n(f)\nRelied on reports, statements, financial data and other information prepared by \u00a0employees with professional or expert advice and did not review the information\n(g)\nDid not receive any reminders from ACRA for the holding of AGMs/filing annual returns etc\nNo reminders will be sent. Company officers ought to be aware of the statutory requirement to file its Annual Return by the respective due dates.\nConclusion\nThis Enforcement Policy Statement represents a summary of our present stand on investigation, compliance and enforcement matters. It is not meant to explain all the applicable laws and any omission of any information herein does not mean that an affected stakeholder will not be investigated or that compliance or enforcement action will not be taken.\nThis Enforcement Policy Statement is not intended to bind ACRA staff and is not meant as a legal guide or provision of any legal advice. \u00a0When in doubt, affected stakeholders should consider seeking independent legal advice.\nThis Enforcement Policy Statement is a live document and is subject to updates. Readers should always refer to the version on ACRA\u2019s website for the most current version.\nImportant: Giving False Information\nPlease also note that the giving of false information in the complaint is a criminal offence and the person who gave the false information may be subject to prosecution and sentenced to a fine and/or imprisonment if convicted.\nDid you find this page useful?\nback to top\nAccounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority\nHow-to Guides\nNews and Events\nLegislation\nProsecution Highlights\nEnforcement Notices\nCorporate Service Providers\nPublic Accountants and Accounting Entities\nAQI Industry Information\nBusiness Registry Statistics\nTraining and Resources\nXBRL Filing and Resources\nSingapore Chartered Accountant Qualification\n2023/06/30\nWho We Are\nCareers\nSign Up for News Update\nBy submitting, I agree to the\nterms and conditions.\nContact Us\nFeedback\nReport Vulnerability\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nRate this Site\nSitemap\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\nBest viewed using IE 11+, Firefox 27+, Chrome 22+ and Safari 7+\n2024/09/04"}, {"title": "\r\n\tEnforcement Notices\r\n", "source": "https://www.acra.gov.sg/enforcement-notices", "content": "Enforcement Notices\nA Singapore Government Agency Website\nHow to identify\nOfficial website links end with .gov.sg\nGovernment agencies communicate via\n.gov.sg\nwebsites\n(e.g. go.gov.sg/open)\n.\nTrusted websites\nSecure websites use HTTPS\nLook for a\nlock\n(\n) or https:// as an added precaution.

However, some business owners may be exempted from registration and therefore not required to do so.\nthis is a youtube video\nWatch a video summary on Do I Have to Register My Business?\nWho needs to register\nYou must register a business if  you are carrying out any activity for profit on an ongoing basis, unless you are  exempted (see below). The minimum age for registration is 18 years old.\nBenefits of registration\nThere are several advantages to registering  a business with ACRA, such as:\nEnabling the public to  search and verify information about your business and its owners.\nMaking it easier for customers  to identify, find, and transact with your business.\nAllowing you to participate in  government tenders and secure intellectual property or patents for new products  and technology.\nGiving your business access  to governmental funding, such as that made available by\nEnterprise Singapore\n.\nIf you choose to incorporate  a company or set up a limited liability partnership (instead of registering a  sole proprietorship or partnership), your personal and business finances are  separated. This means your personal liabilities are limited; in other words, if the  business is sued, you are not in danger of losing your personal assets.\nExemptions from registration\nYour business is exempted from registration  if:\nYou conduct business  using your full name as reflected in your NRIC.\nYou conduct the  business with one or more partners using their full names as reflected in their  NRICs.\nNote: If you add descriptive words before or after your name (e.g. Flowers by Tan Mei Ling), you must register the business.\nThe full list of exemptions is specified in\nSection 4 of the  Business Names Registration Act\n.\nDid you find this page useful?\nback to top\nAccounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority\nHow-to Guides\nNews and Events\nLegislation\nProsecution Highlights\nEnforcement Notices\nCorporate Service Providers\nPublic Accountants and Accounting Entities\nAQI Industry Information\nBusiness Registry Statistics\nTraining and Resources\nXBRL Filing and Resources\nSingapore Chartered Accountant Qualification\n2023/06/30\nWho We Are\nCareers\nSign Up for News Update\nBy submitting, I agree to the\nterms and conditions.\nContact Us\nFeedback\nReport Vulnerability\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nRate this Site\nSitemap\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\nBest viewed using IE 11+, Firefox 27+, Chrome 22+ and Safari 7+\n2024/09/21"}, {"title": "\r\n\tOther important information\r\n", "source": "https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/before-you-start/other-important-information", "content": "Other important information\nA Singapore Government Agency Website\nHow to identify\nOfficial website links end with .gov.sg\nGovernment agencies communicate via\n.gov.sg\nwebsites\n(e.g. go.gov.sg/open)\n.\nTrusted websites\nSecure websites use HTTPS\nLook for a\nlock\n(\n) or https:// as an added precaution.

We are also responsible for developing the accountancy sector and setting the accounting standards for companies, charities, co-operative societies, and societies in Singapore. ACRA fosters a vibrant and trusted business environment that enables innovation and growth and contributes towards making Singapore the best place for business.\nACRA was formed as a statutory board on 1 April 2004, following the merger of the Registry of Companies and Businesses (RCB) and the Public Accountants' Board (PAB). This merger sought\u00a0 \u00a0to achieve synergies between the monitoring of corporate compliance with disclosure requirements and the regulation of public accountants performing statutory audits.\nOn 1 April 2023, ACRA, the Singapore Accountancy Commission (SAC) and the Accounting Standards Council (ASC) merged as one entity, taking on the name, ACRA. The merger aimed to strengthen the effectiveness of regulation, standards-setting, and sector development by harnessing synergies across complementary accountancy-related functions.\nJump to:\nSelect Subheading\nexpand all\ncollapse all\nOverview of ACRA\nBoard Members\nDivisions and Departments\nACRA Academy\nCorporate Law Advisory Panel\nService Commitment\nAwards and Accolades\nAnnual Reports\nACRA's Vision, Mission, Corporate Goals and Values\nVision:\nSingapore: The Best Place for Business\nMission:\nFoster a vibrant and trusted business environment that enables innovation and growth\nCorporate goals:\nACRA's four corporate goals:\nSustainable Business Growth\nHigh Compliance\nExcellent Customer Experience\nHigh Performing Team\nCore values:\nACRA's core values, guide us in all that we do:\nI\nntegrity - We do what is right without fear or favour, and serve with passion and purpose\nT\neamwork         - We help one another be the best that we can be, with mutual trust and respect\nA\ngility - We are resilient and adapt to changes swiftly to do what is best for ACRA\nP\nrofessionalism - We pursue excellence in all that we do; we value our customers and are highly regarded by them\nResponsibilities of ACRA\nACRA is responsible for, inter alia, the following functions:\nTo administer the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Act 2004, the Accountants Act 2004, the Business Names Registration Act 2014, the Companies Act 1967, the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2005, the Limited Partnerships Act 2008\u00a0and the Variable Capital Companies Act 2018;\nTo report and make recommendations to, and advise the Government on matters relating to (i) the registration and regulation of business entities, public accountants and corporate service providers; and (ii) the growth and development of the accountancy sector and its related fields in Singapore;\nTo establish and administer a repository of documents and information relating to business entities, and public accountants; and to provide access to the public to such documents and information;\nTo be responsible for making or formulating accounting standards applicable to companies, charities, co-operative societies and societies in Singapore.\nTo oversee the strategic direction for, and promote, facilitate and assist in, the growth and development of the accountancy sector and its related fields in Singapore;\nTo develop, provide for or administer, or facilitate or collaborate on the development, provision or administration of, programmes, qualifications, certifications, specialisations and continuing professional developments relating to the accountancy sector and its related fields in Singapore;\nTo promote, develop, improve or maintain, or facilitate or collaborate on the promotion, development, improvement or maintenance of, competencies, expertise and professional standards in the accountancy sector and its related fields in Singapore;\nTo develop or manage cooperation and exchange with other persons and organisations, including foreign and international orgnisations, in respect of matters relating to the accountancy sector and its related fields in Singapore;\nTo represent the Government internationally in matters relating to the registration and regulation of business entities and public accountants; and\nTo promote public awareness about new business structures, compliance requirements, corporate governance practice and any matters under ACRA's purview.\nACRA's Data Policy Statement\nAs the national business registry of Singapore, one of ACRA\u2019s functions is to establish and administer a repository of documents and information relating to business entities and public accountants, and to provide access to the public to such documents and information.\nThis is to facilitate trade and interactions among businesses and members of the public, enhance transparency and enable the public to conduct due diligence checks on these entities and the people who operate them.\nMost of the information lodged with ACRA via BizFile\n+\n, ACRA\u2019s on-line registry system, can be accessed by the public upon payment of a fee.\u00a0 Some of the information can also be obtained from ACRA\u2019s authorised Information Service Providers (ISPs).\nInformation for Public Access\nThe information available for public access includes registration date, nature of business activity, registered office address and financial statements of business entities, as well as personal data about owners, shareholders, directors and officers of the business.

Should the use of information by anyone constitute an offence or a breach of the law, he or she may face legal action or criminal prosecution.\nACRA is exempted from the PDPA. The ACRA Act provides for ACRA to disclose personal data in discharging its functions. Nevertheless, ACRA adheres to the Public Sector (Governance) Act and Government Instruction Manuals with respect to the way data is managed.

Employers should revisit the value proposition that they offer their employee accountants and adjust as needed to meet their changing aspirations and meet their desire for purposeful work.\nRedesign reward structure.\nAnnouncements by Accounting Entities on the adjustments to starting salaries.\nCreate Quality Pathways\n, by increasing the accessibility of an accountancy career to talent from diverse sources. ACRA will work with the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (ISCA) to make the Singapore Chartered Accountant Qualification (SCAQ) more streamlined and accessible to candidates of different backgrounds, while universities should work with employers to expand work-study\u00a0opportunities, which will improve the work-readiness of students and facilitate their entry into the accountancy profession.\nWork-study opportunities:\nLaunch of the new WSDeg by Nanyang Technological University (Bachelor of Accountancy (Sustainability Management and Analytics).\nA programme to support non-accountancy graduates develop core accounting competencies by Ngee Ann Polytechnic (Accountancy Careers Launchpad).\nACRA will explore partnering institutes of higher learning to provide more structured training and employment opportunities, with possible integration with the SCAQ.\nPathways for non-accountancy students:\nACRA will work with universities to develop and introduce accountancy minors and double degrees (with accountancy), to expose more students to basic accounting and possible career options in the accounting sector.\nEnhancements to SCAQ:\nAccountancy polytechnic graduates are no longer required to pursue the Advanced Diploma in order to enrol in the SCAQ.\nNon-Accountancy polytechnic graduates\u00a0such as Business Management, or even Engineering, will be able to enrol in the SCAQ.\nStreamlining SCAQ:\nPolytechnic accountancy graduates will be exempted from the Principles of Financial Reporting module and/or Taxation module of the SCAQ Foundation Programme if they had completed the equivalent module during their studies.\nRecognition of up to 18 months of prior practical experience in the fulfilment of the 3 years of relevant practical experience.\nACRA will continue to study the possibility of granting exemptions for the SCAQ\u2019s modules to reduce the length of time required for candidates to complete the SCAQ, if candidates have fulfilled the necessary prerequisites.\nStrengthen Professional Capabilities\n, to develop future-ready professionals to navigate changes and seize opportunities. ACRA will work with the relevant regulators and ISCA to enhance the recognition of the Chartered Accountant (Singapore) designation and the learning support provided for the SCAQ, while ensuring that the relevant curriculum equips accountants with capabilities in emerging areas.\nImprove recognition of CA (Singapore):\nThere is a need to emphasise to listed companies to employ\u00a0accountants with professional qualifications from reputable\u00a0accountancy bodies, such as the Singapore Chartered\u00a0Accountancy qualification in their key finance functions.

To ensure independence, a majority of PAOC members are not public accountants.\nRegistration\nEnsuring that public accountants are prepared for the responsibilities of an auditor\nThe main reason for registering as a public accountant is so that a person can provide public accountancy services such as audit and reporting on financial statements in Singapore. A public accountant is responsible for the issuance of audit opinions, and this responsibility includes ensuring that audits are conducted in accordance with the professional standards (i.e. Singapore Standards on Auditing (SSAs) and/or other requirements).\nRegistration as a public accountant is also necessary for performing other acts that are required by law to be done by a public accountant, such as appointment as a judicial manager under the Accountants Act.\nThere is no need to register as a public accountant to provide other accountancy services in Singapore, such as accounting, tax and corporate advisory work.\nTo register as a public accountant, ACRA requires applicants to have:\nthe prescribed qualifications\nthe prescribed audit experience\nthe prescribed amount of continuing professional education\nmembership with the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (ISCA) and registered as a Chartered Accountant of Singapore.\nFind out more about the registration requirements and how to register as a\npublic accountant\n.\nMonitoring\nEnsuring that public accountants base their audit opinions on sufficient and appropriate work and audit evidence\nRegistered public accountants must adhere to the\u00a0Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics, keep up to date technically through continuing professional education and have their audit work inspected under ACRA\u2019s Practice Monitoring Programme (PMP).\nUnder the PMP, ACRA inspects audits performed by public accountants to check if they have complied with the professional standards (i.e. SSAs\n1\nand/or other requirements\n2\n).\nFind out more about ACRA's PMP\n.\nFor accounting entities, ACRA assesses the quality controls (QC reviews) of such entities against the Singapore Standards on Quality Management (SSQM 1 and SSQM 2)\n3\n.\nACRA's Audit Quality Indicator Disclosure Framework\nTo enable Audit Committees of listed companies to better evaluate and select the right auditor, ACRA has introduced an Audit Quality Indicator (AQI) Disclosure Framework.\nThe AQI framework comprises 7 quality markers, which includes involvement of audit team members during each audit phase, years of audit experience and industry specialisation of audit team members as well as results from internal and external inspections of auditors.\nFind out more about AQI Disclosure Framework\n.\nWorking with partners to promote high quality audit\nMany groups contribute to audit quality in addition to auditors, especially directors, preparers of financial statements and investors. To foster a strong eco-system that promotes audit quality, ACRA works with partners in the profession and the business community in a concerted effort to provide help to public accountants, and educate business people about their roles in the audit process as well as the value of a good audit.\nLearn more about ACRA's events and resources relating to\naudit quality\n.\n1\nCopies of the SSAs can be obtained from\nwww.isca.org.sg\n2\nFor instance, the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs), which may be applied for (and only for) audits of (i) local entities that are listed overseas; and (b) foreign entities listed in Singapore.

For example, failure to file with ACRA the ARs for a few consecutive years.\nDirectors with at least 3 companies struck off by ACRA* within a period of 5 years will be subject to disqualification. Once disqualified, the individual will not be allowed to be appointed as a company director or take part in the management of any local or foreign company. The disqualification period for directors disqualified for the first time is three years, commencing after the date on which the last company is struck off by ACRA. Directors who have a similar previous disqualification will be disqualified for five years, commencing after the date on which the last company is struck off by ACRA.\n*This refers to striking off initiated by the Registrar and does not include voluntary applications for striking off.\nDebarment Order\nThe Registrar is also empowered to debar any director or company secretary for non-compliance with their statutory duties under the Companies Act (CA), including failure to lodge any documents, for a continuous period of 3 months or more. A debarred person cannot take on any new appointments as a director or company secretary of other companies.\nMaking an Appeal to ACRA\nIf a director would like to appeal to ACRA for a review of the summonses issued against him or to reduce the composition sum or late filing penalty (for Annual Returns), he would have to complete this\neForm\nand attach\nsupporting documents\nfor the appeal.\nThe processing time for appeal is generally 4 weeks, depending on its complexity. This may take longer during peak period or if further clarifications are required. Each appeal is assessed and considered on its own merits.\nDid you find this page useful?\nback to top\nAccounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority\nHow-to Guides\nNews and Events\nLegislation\nProsecution Highlights\nEnforcement Notices\nCorporate Service Providers\nPublic Accountants and Accounting Entities\nAQI Industry Information\nBusiness Registry Statistics\nTraining and Resources\nXBRL Filing and Resources\nSingapore Chartered Accountant Qualification\n2023/06/30\nWho We Are\nCareers\nSign Up for News Update\nBy submitting, I agree to the\nterms and conditions.\nContact Us\nFeedback\nReport Vulnerability\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nRate this Site\nSitemap\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\nBest viewed using IE 11+, Firefox 27+, Chrome 22+ and Safari 7+\n2024/09/04"}, {"title": "\r\n\tUpdating Information of Limited Partnerships\r\n", "source": "https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/updating-information-of-limited-partnerships", "content": "Updating Information of Limited Partnerships\nA Singapore Government Agency Website\nHow to identify\nOfficial website links end with .gov.sg\nGovernment agencies communicate via\n.gov.sg\nwebsites\n(e.g. go.gov.sg/open)\n.\nTrusted websites\nSecure websites use HTTPS\nLook for a\nlock\n(\n) or https:// as an added precaution.

The PMSC then reports to the PAOC with recommended outcome and actions, if its view is that the public accountant has failed to observe, maintain or apply the prescribed professional standards\n1\n, or that compliance with the professional standards is assessed to be partially satisfactory or not satisfactory\n2\n.\nThe PAOC decides on the review outcome and, if it concludes that the public accountant has failed to observe, maintain or apply the prescribed professional standards\n1\n, or that compliance with the professional standards is assessed to be partially satisfactory or not satisfactory\n2\n, orders the public accountant to undertake remedial actions, or makes other orders to protect the public interest.

Audit quality is the cornerstone of market confidence in the reliability of the financial information upon which the market makes capital allocation decisions.\nThe PMP provides quality assurance to the market through ascertaining whether public accountants have complied with the prescribed auditing standards, methods, procedures and other requirements. This assurance gives users of financial reports increased confidence in audit opinions.\nWith effect from 1 July 2023, ACRA's inspection powers were expanded to include quality control review on accounting entities, so that audit firms will deliver consistent high audit quality.\nThe Audit Regulatory Reports are available\nhere\n.\nDid you find this page useful?\nback to top\nAccounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority\nHow-to Guides\nNews and Events\nLegislation\nProsecution Highlights\nEnforcement Notices\nCorporate Service Providers\nPublic Accountants and Accounting Entities\nAQI Industry Information\nBusiness Registry Statistics\nTraining and Resources\nXBRL Filing and Resources\nSingapore Chartered Accountant Qualification\n2023/06/30\nWho We Are\nCareers\nSign Up for News Update\nBy submitting, I agree to the\nterms and conditions.\nContact Us\nFeedback\nReport Vulnerability\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nRate this Site\nSitemap\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\nBest viewed using IE 11+, Firefox 27+, Chrome 22+ and Safari 7+\n2024/06/11"}, {"title": "\r\n\tSole-Proprietor and Partnership Fees\r\n", "source": "https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/sole-proprietor-and-partnership-fees", "content": "Sole-Proprietor and Partnership Fees\nA Singapore Government Agency Website\nHow to identify\nOfficial website links end with .gov.sg\nGovernment agencies communicate via\n.gov.sg\nwebsites\n(e.g. go.gov.sg/open)\n.\nTrusted websites\nSecure websites use HTTPS\nLook for a\nlock\n(\n) or https:// as an added precaution.

all\nOverview\nInvestigations\nCompliance and Enforcement Measures\nFiling a Complaint on Alleged Offences\nMaking Representations to ACRA on Compliance or Investigative Matters\nOnce it has been ascertained that a matter has satisfied all 3 factors, ACRA will commence investigations.\nPowers of investigations\nDuly authorised ACRA officers have the power under the ACRA Act to:\nrequire any person whom he reasonably believes to have committed that offence to furnish evidence of the person\u2019s identity;\nrequire any person to furnish any information or produce any book, document or copy thereof in the possession of that person, and may, without fee or reward, inspect, make copies of or take extracts from such book or document;\nrequire, by order in writing, the attendance before the officer or employee of any person within the limits of Singapore who, from any information given or otherwise obtained by the officer or employee, appears to be acquainted with the circumstances of the case;\nexamine orally any person reasonably believed to be acquainted with the facts or circumstances of the case or with such other matter as the officer or employee may specify, and reduce into writing the answer given or statement made by that person;\ntake such photographs or video recording, as the officer or employee thinks necessary, of the premises in which or in connection with which he reasonably believes an offence has been committed and persons reasonably believed to be acquainted with the facts or circumstances of the case or with such other matter as the officer or employee may specify; and,\nrequire the owner or occupier of any premises in which or in connection with which the officer or employee of the Authority reasonably believes an offence has been committed to give the officer or employee access to such premises without charge for the purpose of investigating that offence.\nInvestigation timelines\nACRA will send the complainant an acknowledgement\u00a0 when a complaint is received. Thereafter, updates will be provided at appropriate junctures. The ability to provide updates will depend on the information and evidence that have been gathered, the complexity of the case, caseload and other relevant factors.\nIt is important for complainants to note that while some complaints may appear straightforward and easy to investigate, it may not always the case. At times, individuals who are material to these matters cannot be found or are not even within jurisdiction and these greatly impede our ability to investigate further.\nPost-Investigation\nAfter investigations have been completed, ACRA has the discretion to:\nrequest a person to rectify a matter;\nissue an advisory against a person;\nissue a warning to a person;\nallow a person to compound for a breach;\nrefuse to allow composition and to prosecute the person in court;\nutilise any other regulatory tool available; or\ntake no further action.\nOther regulatory tools that ACRA can utilise include:\nstriking off\n- If a company has persistently failed to hold its Annual General Meeting or failed to file its AR, has an outdated registered business address or does not respond to ACRA\u2019s letters, these may be considered reasonable causes for ACRA to believe that the company is not in operation or not carrying on business and ACRA may then initiate striking off action to strike off the company from its register.\ndisqualification\n- In 2016, ACRA introduced a new enforcement power whereby a director who has at least 3 of his companies struck off by ACRA within a period of 5 years will be disqualified from acting as director or to take part in the management of any company for a period of 5 years from the date after the third company is struck off.\ndebarment order\n- In 2016, ACRA introduced a new enforcement power whereby a director or company secretary who is in default of a relevant requirement in the Companies Act may face a debarment order from the Registrar preventing him from taking on new appointments as director or company secretary of other companies.\nComplainants need to understand that it is within the discretion of ACRA whether to take enforcement action or to take no further action. ACRA will consider each case independently, fairly and consistently before reaching a decision.\nIn deciding whether to prosecute an offender ACRA takes into account the following:\nthe sufficiency of evidence gathered; and\nwhether other regulatory tools will be more appropriate. \u00a0For example - first time offenders may be offered a chance to attend a training programme in lieu of facing enforcement and prosecution (For example, those who failed to hold Annual General Meeting and file Annual Return timely may be asked to attend the Director\u2019s Compliance Programme)\nIf indeed the decision taken is to prosecute the offender in court, ACRA will also consider if the offence is premeditated, prevalent and/or if the offender is a repeat offender before deciding whether to press for a deterrent sentence.\nDid you find this page useful?\nback to top\nAccounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority\nHow-to Guides\nNews and Events\nLegislation\nProsecution Highlights\nEnforcement Notices\nCorporate Service Providers\nPublic Accountants and Accounting Entities\nAQI Industry Information\nBusiness Registry Statistics\nTraining and Resources\nXBRL Filing and Resources\nSingapore Chartered Accountant Qualification\n2023/06/30\nWho We Are\nCareers\nSign Up for News Update\nBy submitting, I agree to the\nterms and conditions.\nContact Us\nFeedback\nReport Vulnerability\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nRate this Site\nSitemap\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\nBest viewed using IE 11+, Firefox 27+, Chrome 22+ and Safari 7+\n2023/05/10"}, {"title": "\r\n\tApplication for Consent to Resign as Auditor of Public Interest Companies, Variable Capital Companies or Their Subsidiaries\r\n", "source": "https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/application-for-consent-to-resign-as-auditor-of-public-interest-companies-or-their-subsidiaries", "content": "Application for Consent to Resign as Auditor of Public Interest Companies, Variable Capital Companies or Their Subsidiaries\nA Singapore Government Agency Website\nHow to identify\nOfficial website links end with .gov.sg\nGovernment agencies communicate via\n.gov.sg\nwebsites\n(e.g. go.gov.sg/open)\n.\nTrusted websites\nSecure websites use HTTPS\nLook for a\nlock\n(\n) or https:// as an added precaution.

A foreign corporate entity that re-domiciles to Singapore to become a registered VCC, is required to comply with the VCC Act. Re-domiciliation will not affect the obligations, liabilities, properties or rights of the foreign corporate entity.\nRequirements\nSolvency criteria:\n\u2022 All the directors of the foreign corporate entity have formed the opinion that the foreign corporate entity meets the minimum requirements mentioned in regulation 9(1)(a)and (b) of the Variable Capital Companies (Transfer of Registration) Regulations 2020\n\u2022 The foreign corporate entity is authorised to transfer its incorporation under the law of its place of incorporation;\n\u2022 The foreign corporate entity has complied with the requirements of the law of its place of incorporation in relation to the transfer of its incorporation;\n\u2022 The application for registration under section 134(1) of the VCC Act is \u2014\na. not intended to defraud existing creditors of the foreign corporate entity; and\nb. made in good faith;\n\u2022 There are other minimum requirements such as the foreign corporate entity is not under judicial management, not in liquidation or being wound up etc.\nHow to apply\nPlease check if your proposed name is available by conducting a name search at \u00a0VCC Portal (\nwww.vcc.bizfile.gov.sg\n) using the search directory\u00a0before you submit your application. A non-refundable fee of $9,000 + [$400 x number of sub-funds] is payable for application for Transfer of Registration. You may include sub-funds in the application for Transfer of Registration if the foreign corporate entity consists of two or more collective investment schemes (CIS).\nYou can proceed to submit your application using \"Application for Transfer of Registration\" via the\u00a0VCC Portal\u00a0(\nwww.vcc.bizfile.gov.sg\n).\nProcessing time for Transfer of Registration\nIt may take 14 to 60 days from the date of submission of all required documentation, to process the transfer of registration application. This includes the time required for referral to another government agency for approval or review, if necessary. For more information on Referral Authorities, please click\nhere\nAfter Registration\nThe applicant will be notified of the outcome of the application by email. Upon approval, the foreign corporate entity will be registered as a VCC in Singapore.

E.g. a    ratio of 7% means that for every $100 of sale, there is $7 available for    distribution.\nReturn    on Assets (%)\n-\n[(Profit    (loss), net of tax + Income tax expense + Finance costs)/ Total assets] x 100\nThis    measures how effectively the company uses its resources, in generating profit.\nE.g. a ratio of 25% means that, for every $100 in assets, the company    generates a profit of $25 before interest and tax for owners and    creditors.\nReturn    on Equity (%)\n-\n[Profit    (loss), net of tax / Total equity] x 100\nThis    measures the profitability of capital invested in the company by the    owners.\nE.g. a ratio of 30% means that for every $100 invested, the company yields a    profit of $30 for the owners.\nTotal    Liabilities to Equity (Times)\nFinancial    Ratio (Solvency)\nTotal    liabilities / Total equity\nThis    measures the extent to which the company is leveraged.\nA    higher ratio indicates that the company is more dependent on debt to finance    its operations.\nTotal    Assets Turnover (Times)\nFinancial    Ratio (Operating)\nRevenue    / Total assets\nThis    measures the company's efficiency in using its assets to generate sales or    revenue.\nInterest    Cover Ratio (Times)\n-\n(Profit    (loss), net of tax + Income tax expense + Finance costs) / Finance costs\nThis measures a company\u2019s ability to pay interest    on its outstanding debt.\nDefinitions  of Audit Opinions\nTypes of Audit Opinion\nExplanation\nUnqualified Opinion\nThe auditor concludes that the financial statements    give a true and fair view or are presented fairly, in all material respects,    in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework.\nEmphasis of Matter (EOM)\nThis is to \"highlight a matter affecting the    financial statements which is included in a note to the financial statements    that more extensively discusses the matter. The addition of such an emphasis    of matter paragraph does not affect the auditor's opinion.\u201d\nQualified Opinion*\nThe auditor concludes that an unqualified opinion    cannot be expressed but that the effect of any disagreement with management,    or limitation on scope is not so material and pervasive as to require an    adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion.\nDisclaimer of Opinion*\nThis is expressed when the \"possible effect of a    limitation on scope is so material and pervasive that the auditor has not    been able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence and accordingly is    unable to express an opinion on the financial statements.\"\nAdverse Opinion*\nThis is expressed when the \"effect of a    disagreement is so material and pervasive to the financial statements that    the auditor concludes that a qualification of the report is not adequate to    disclose the misleading or incomplete nature of the financial statements.\u201d\n*Definitions according to SSA 700\n\u201cThe Independent Auditor\u2019s Report on a Complete Set of General Purpose  Financial Statements\u201d\nand\nSSA701 \u201cModifications to the Independent  Auditor\u2019s Report\u201d.\nThe CCFP  for a selected entity may not be available for the following reasons:\nThe entity is a gazetted / de-gazetted company;\nThe entity  has not filed their financial statements / accounts with ACRA in the recent two  to three years;\nThe entity\u2019s  financial statements / accounts are not filed in XBRL format (e.g. filing of  PDF accounts only);\nThe entity\u2019  assets and liabilities are presented in order of liquidity, instead of current  / non-current classification;\nThe entity is  exempt from audit requirements;\nInvalid computation results.\nHow to buy:\nA Corporate Compliance and Financial Profile costs $50.00.\nTo purchase the product:\nLogin at\nBizFile\n+\nGo to Buy Information\nUpon successful payment, an email on the guide for product download will be sent to you within 15 minutes.\nAlternatively, if the purchase is done via Singpass, you can login at ACRA\u00a0BizFile\n+\nportal, click on Messages to access the above same email message.\nDownload for purchased product will expire 7 days from date of purchase, no further extension can be made.\nDid you find this page useful?\nback to top\nAccounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority\nHow-to Guides\nNews and Events\nLegislation\nProsecution Highlights\nEnforcement Notices\nCorporate Service Providers\nPublic Accountants and Accounting Entities\nAQI Industry Information\nBusiness Registry Statistics\nTraining and Resources\nXBRL Filing and Resources\nSingapore Chartered Accountant Qualification\n2023/06/30\nWho We Are\nCareers\nSign Up for News Update\nBy submitting, I agree to the\nterms and conditions.\nContact Us\nFeedback\nReport Vulnerability\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nRate this Site\nSitemap\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\nBest viewed using IE 11+, Firefox 27+, Chrome 22+ and Safari 7+\n2023/11/27"}, {"title": "\r\n\tPackage Information\r\n", "source": "https://www.acra.gov.sg/how-to-guides/buying-information/package-information", "content": "Package Information\nA Singapore Government Agency Website\nHow to identify\nOfficial website links end with .gov.sg\nGovernment agencies communicate via\n.gov.sg\nwebsites\n(e.g. go.gov.sg/open)\n.\nTrusted websites\nSecure websites use HTTPS\nLook for a\nlock\n(\n) or https:// as an added precaution.

By the end of 2024, Contact Address will be shown in ACRA\u2019s public records in place of the residential address.\nTransitioning to the new Contact Address Regime\nFor Individuals who are Position Holders (e.g. company directors, business owners) and Public Accountants\nCurrently, there is the option to provide an Alternate Address at a fee of $40 which will be displayed in ACRA\u2019s public records in place of the residential address. The Contact Address regime will replace the existing Alternate Address regime by the end of 2024.\nTo facilitate the transition to the new Contact Address regime, all existing Alternate Addresses filed with ACRA will be automatically converted to Contact Addresses by the end of the year.\nWe strongly encourage individuals who have not previously opted for an Alternate Address to consider providing one to ACRA before the Contact Address regime commences by the end of this year. Their residential address will continue to be publicly displayed as their Contact Address until a different address is provided to ACRA. The $40 fee for filing an Alternate Address will be waived from\n23 August 2024\nonwards. No action is needed for individuals who prefer to use their residential address as their Contact Address.\nFor Individuals who are solely shareholders\nThese individuals may wish to engage their company secretaries or Corporate Service Providers to check the address currently registered with ACRA. If it is a residential address, they can choose to provide another address to ACRA that they would like to be reflected as the Contact Address when the regime takes effect by end of the year.\nFor Corporate Service Providers\nCorporate service providers are urged to check their clients' preferred addresses and update ACRA accordingly.\nUpdating Alternate Address for Individuals who are Position Holders or Public Accountants\nIndividuals who are existing position holders or public accountants can provide an Alternate Address through the various eServices in\nBizFile+\n(refer to the table below).

and\nStreamline the financial reporting requirements for foreign companies registered under the CA.\nThe Bill makes amendments to the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Act 2004, the Accountants Act 2004, the Business Names Registration Act 2014, the Companies Act 1967, the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018, the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2005, the Limited Partnerships Act 2008 and the Variable Capital Companies Act 2018.\nMore details on the transition plans for legislative changes relating to contact address and digital communications, including the fee waiver for filing of alternate addresses, will be made known by early August.\nKey Legislative Changes\nKey changes\nReasons for the amendments\nStrike a balance between corporate transparency and personal data protection\nTo introduce contact address as the default address that will be shown to the public, instead of the individual\u2019s residential address. Individuals may choose to use their residential address as their contact address. The existing alternate address regime will be abolished.\nTo facilitate the introduction of contact address:\n(a) Individuals\u2019 existing alternate address will be auto-converted and kept in ACRA\u2019s register as their contact address upon commencement of the contact address regime; and\n(b) For individuals without an alternate address, the individual\u2019s residential address as kept in ACRA\u2019s register will be auto-converted and kept in ACRA\u2019s register as their contact address.\nResidential address will continue to be required to be filed, except that they will not be made public. This amendment will apply only in respect of documents that are filed with the Registrar on or after the commencement date of the provision as well as the information that will be presented in the registers that are kept by the Registrar.\nThe amendment strikes a balance between corporate transparency and enhancing personal data protection. The amendment is intended to better cater to concerns with personal data protection.\nTo enable the Registrar to exclude documents from the documents that the Registrar is required to provide copies of or allow the public to inspect. This amendment will apply only in respect of documents that are filed with the Registrar on or after the commencement date of the provision.\nTo empower the Minister to specify the documents that the Registrar may exclude from public access.\nThe amendment addresses circumstances where it does not serve corporate transparency purposes or where it may not be appropriate for the documents to be made available to the public for inspection or purchase. The circumstances include where the document contains commercially sensitive information or sensitive personal information.\nTo make amendments to empower:\n(a) the Registrar or the Authority to disclose data in accordance with the tiered framework; and\n(b) the Minister to amend the tiered framework to calibrate the disclosure of data in ACRA\u2019s repository to different persons or classes or people.\nThe amendments enable the Registrar and the Authority to take a differentiated approach in sharing the different types of data collected.\nFor example, the framework will exclude residential address from public records for personal data protection purposes, but the residential address may be provided to financial institutions for regulatory purposes such as customer due diligence verifications.\nFacilitate digital communications with businesses and other stakeholders\nTo make amendments so that:\n(a) the Registrar or the Authority may send document and information, other than summons, by way of sending such document and information digitally to the digital mailbox in Bizfile;\n(b) recipients may be notified via electronic means on how and when to access information and document sent by the Registrar or the Authority.\nThis will allow ACRA to transition from sending of hard copy documents to sending document and information digitally via a secure digital mailbox in Bizfile. Access to this system will be restricted to authorised individuals using Singpass/ Corppass, ensuring the security and privacy of the content of these documents and information.\nAny summons sent by the Registrar will continue to be sent via hard copy to the registered address of the entity or the residential address of an individual.\nTo enable the Registrar to require and collect any information for any purpose of the ACRA Act or an ACRA-administered Act in addition to information relevant to the transaction, by way of the forms in Bizfile. Such information includes email address and mobile number.\nThis will facilitate Government-to-Business digital communications.\nImprove filing convenience and data accuracy\nTo empower the Registrar or the Authority to obtain and use information from prescribed public agencies, such that:\n(a) a person will not need to input the data with ACRA during the filing of a transaction and the person will be deemed to have complied with the filing requirement; and\n(b) ACRA may use the information to maintain, rectify or update ACRA\u2019s repository or registers (e.g. changes in particulars of a director such as full name, residential address and nationality).\nTo empower the Minister to specify the prescribed public agencies.\nThis will lead to greater convenience to persons and entities by reducing the number of times they are required to provide data to government agencies.\nTo enable the Registrar or the Authority to obtain any information from a prescribed entity for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any document or information in ACRA\u2019s repository.\nTo empower the Minister to specify the prescribed entities.\nThe additional powers relating to the use of information from body corporates will improve the accuracy of data in ACRA\u2019s registers.\nEnhance the accuracy of the registers of directors\nTo make it clear that the Registrar is empowered to:\n(a) reflect the disqualification status of individuals disqualified under any section of the CA; and\n(b) use information obtained from the courts for the purpose of exercising the power to reflect the disqualification status of individuals disqualified under any section of the CA in ACRA's register.\nThis clarifies that the Registrar is empowered to indicate the disqualification status of individuals disqualified under any section of the CA in the register.\nStreamline the financial reporting requirements\u00a0for foreign companies registered under the CA\nTo streamline the financial reporting requirement for foreign companies by requiring foreign companies to lodge with the Registrar different types of financial statements, depending on the circumstances of the foreign company.\nThis clarifies the financial reporting requirements for foreign companies and reduces administrative burden on certain foreign companies by allowing them to file the applicable financial statements that they have already prepared.\nFor more information and related FAQs on the above amendments, please click\nhere\n(PDF, 23KB).\nImplementation Timeline\nACRA will provide sufficient lead time for the implementation of the proposed amendments.\nDocuments related to the Bill\u2019s passage through Parliament\nPlease access the following links for more information on:\n1.\nACRA (Registry and Regulatory Enhancements) Bill\n2.\nSecond Reading Speech of the\u00a0ACRA (Registry and Regulatory Enhancements) Bill\n3.\nACRA\u2019s Public Consultation on Proposed Legislative Amendments Relating to Data, Digitalisation and Corporate Transparency for a Trusted and Vibrant Business Environment in Singapore\n4.\nACRA\u2019s Response to Public Consultation on Proposals Relating to Personal Data Collection and Use, Filing Convenience and Digital Correspondences and Other Proposed Amendments\n(\nPDF, 111KB)\n5.\nMOF\u2019s and ACRA\u2019s Public Consultation on Proposed Legislative Amendments Relating to Digital Communications and Regulatory Enhancements\n6.\nMOF\u2019s and ACRA\u2019s Summary of Responses to Consultation Feedback on Digital Communications and Regulatory Enhancements\nDid you find this page useful?\nback to top\nAccounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority\nHow-to Guides\nNews and Events\nLegislation\nProsecution Highlights\nEnforcement Notices\nCorporate Service Providers\nPublic Accountants and Accounting Entities\nAQI Industry Information\nBusiness Registry Statistics\nTraining and Resources\nXBRL Filing and Resources\nSingapore Chartered Accountant Qualification\n2023/06/30\nWho We Are\nCareers\nSign Up for News Update\nBy submitting, I agree to the\nterms and conditions.\nContact Us\nFeedback\nReport Vulnerability\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nRate this Site\nSitemap\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\nBest viewed using IE 11+, Firefox 27+, Chrome 22+ and Safari 7+\n2024/08/22"}, {"title": "\r\n\tNew trustBar verification service provides added assurance on authenticity of ACRA-s Business Profiles and Business Certificates\r\n", "source": "https://www.acra.gov.sg/announcements/trustbar", "content": "New trustBar verification service provides added assurance on authenticity of ACRA-s Business Profiles and Business Certificates\nA Singapore Government Agency Website\nHow to identify\nOfficial website links end with .gov.sg\nGovernment agencies communicate via\n.gov.sg\nwebsites\n(e.g. go.gov.sg/open)\n.\nTrusted websites\nSecure websites use HTTPS\nLook for a\nlock\n(\n) or https:// as an added precaution.

They are used for various business-related activities where verification of key information on the business and the people involved are needed.\nGiving assurance on the authenticity of ACRA's Business Profiles and Business Certificates\nACRA's trust\nBar\nverification service enables quick and easy verification of the authenticity of ACRA's Business Profiles and Business Certificates (Incorporation/Registration).\nThe service leverages the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech)'s OpenAttestation (OA) - an open-source framework for the endorsement and verification of documents.\nNew Certification Feature for Business Profile\nACRA's Business Profiles have also been enhanced with a new certification feature (bearing ACRA\u2019s stamp and ACRA Assistant Registrar\u2019s name and signature) with no change to its purchase fee of $5.50. \u00a0With this enhancement, customers will no longer need to purchase the information product \u201cBusiness Profile with Certificate of Production\u201d which costs $16.50. Hence, the \u201cBusiness Profile with Certificate of Production\u201d will be discontinued from 4 March 2023.\nVerification API Service for mass verification purposes\nA verification API service will also be offered through the\nACRA APIMall\nportal\u00a0for software developers to integrate the API into their existing processes, enabling machine to machine workflows for seamless mass verification purposes.\nHow trust\nBar\nworks\nFrom 4 March 2023, each Business Profile and Business Certificate (Incorporation/Registration) issued by ACRA will come in two formats \u2013 \u00a0a Portable Document Format (PDF) file for viewing and an OA file for product verification. Customers can verify the authenticity of the business profile or business certificate in the\ntrust\nBar\nportal\nusing one of the following methods:\nVerification Method 1\nScan the QR code located at the lower right-hand corner of the PDF document. This will direct you to the verification result in the trust\nBar\nportal.\nVerification Method 2\nEnter the verification URL found in the PDF document into an internet browser to access the verification result in the trust\nBar\nportal.\nVerification Method 3\nUpload the OA file at the ACRA trust\nBar\nportal to view the verification result.\nVerification of the PDF document\nIf the document is verified to be issued by ACRA, the results will show a green tick; and if the document is not issued by ACRA, the results will show a red cross.\nFor verification results showing a green tick, the entire Business Profile or Business Certificate will be displayed on screen. Customers can check if the PDF document has been altered by comparing it against the PDF document on the screen. Alternatively, they can request for the OA file from the document sender.\nPrint Verification Results\nCustomers can print a copy of the business profile or business certificate, which contains the trust\nBar\nwatermark, verification date and time as confirmation that\u00a0documents have been verified through trust\nBar.\nOther Verification Portals\nCustomers can also verify the OA files of the Business Profiles and Business Certificates (Incorporation/Registration) at the following government verification portals:\n-\nTrade Trust\n-\nVerify\nNext Phase of Implementation\nACRA will gradually extend this verification capability to the rest of the business information products (such as other certificates and registers) issued by ACRA.\nNew currency feature for Business Certificates (Incorporation/Registration)\nFrom 8 Dec 2023, you can check if the information found in Business Certificates (Incorporation/Registration) is up to date.\nFor more information, please\nclick here\n.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nPlease\nrefer to the list of\nFAQs\non ACRA's trust\nBar\nverification service.\nJump to:\nSelect Subheading\nexpand all\ncollapse all\nDid you find this page useful?\nback to top\nAccounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority\nHow-to Guides\nNews and Events\nLegislation\nProsecution Highlights\nEnforcement Notices\nCorporate Service Providers\nPublic Accountants and Accounting Entities\nAQI Industry Information\nBusiness Registry Statistics\nTraining and Resources\nXBRL Filing and Resources\nSingapore Chartered Accountant Qualification\n2023/06/30\nWho We Are\nCareers\nSign Up for News Update\nBy submitting, I agree to the\nterms and conditions.\nContact Us\nFeedback\nReport Vulnerability\nPrivacy Statement\nTerms of Use\nRate this Site\nSitemap\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Government of Singapore.\nBest viewed using IE 11+, Firefox 27+, Chrome 22+ and Safari 7+\n2023/12/07"}, {"title": "\r\n\tNew trustBar currency feature for Business Certificates to aid business decision making\r\n", "source": "https://www.acra.gov.sg/announcements/new-trustbar-currency-feature-for-business-certificates-to-aid-business-decision-making", "content": "New trustBar currency feature for Business Certificates to aid business decision making\nA Singapore Government Agency Website\nHow to identify\nOfficial website links end with .gov.sg\nGovernment agencies communicate via\n.gov.sg\nwebsites\n(e.g. go.gov.sg/open)\n.\nTrusted websites\nSecure websites use HTTPS\nLook for a\nlock\n(\n) or https:// as an added precaution.
